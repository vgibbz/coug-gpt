The University seeks to develop in each learner the capability to distinguish fact\\nfrom fallacy, truth from error, and freedom from license.\\nThe University does not cultivate the mind at the expense of the heart.

As a community of learners, CCU recognizes that this understanding of God in Jesus Christ is the beginning of wisdom.\\nThe University's primary academic focus is on excellence in teaching, while providing opportunities for research and performance by both faculty and students. The\\nUniversity prizes academic excellence as a virtue and encourages students to strive for such excellence.\\nCCU is a university of the liberal arts and professions with institutional roots that include an undiminished respect for the authority and truthfulness of Scripture as the\\nfoundation of God’s creative revelation of Himself to humanity. The Bible offers a sure foundation for understanding God, humanity, and the world, and for sound thinking,\\nwise living, and Colorado Christian University Policy effective service. The arts and sciences belong to God and are to be prized, explored, enjoyed, and ineuenced by\\nChristians. As a result, students gain broad exposure to art, history, literature, music, philosophy, science, and other delds of study, all of which are informed from a biblical\\nperspective. Equally the University believes that Christian scholarship is practical and that upon the foundation of the biblically-informed liberal arts curriculum, students\\nmust be enabled to work productively in society and to earn a living.\\nColorado Christian University\\n5 / 1000\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As Paul urged the Ephesians, we also urge one another \"to live a life worthy of the calling you have received\" (Eph 4:1).\\nAs an educational institution, we believe that our students learn important lessons about spirituality, character, integrity, and morality by observing within the institution the\\nChrist-like values lived out by respected role models.\\nAs a result, our institutional mission is fuldlled in part as members of the CCU community - students, faculty, staff, and administrators - consciously seek a lifestyle that is both\\npleasing to Christ and exemplary to those who may be observing. To foster fuldllment of this aspect of our mission, we dedne guidelines for the behavior and conduct that are\\nexpected of those who choose to be part of our community.\\nMission and Strategic Priorities\\nStatement of Faith\\nColorado Christian University unites with the broad, historic evangelical faith rather than afdliating with any specidc denomination. In this commitment, the University\\nembraces the following declarations of the National Association of Evangelicals:\\n• We Believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.\\n• We Believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n• We Believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood,\\nin His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory.\\n• We Believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful people, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential.\\n• We Believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.\\n• We Believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of\\ndamnation.\\n• We Believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.\\nThese declarations do not comprise all that individual Christians may consider important elements of faith; rather, they establish the essential framework within which\\nmembers of the University both unite in shared beliefs and explore differences.\\nStatement of Convictions\\nCCU is a Christian institution of higher education. Our University rests on a belief system where truth matters and where there is a unifying center (Christ) which holds all\\nthings and disciplines together. This has been our conviction since our founding in 1914, and it continues to be our conviction today. But truth is to be held and lived out in\\nlove. Hence our motto, \"grace and truth.\" (John 1:14-16; Ephesians 4:15)\\nHoly Scripture:We have always believed in the truthfulness of the Bible. We understand the use of the word \"infallibility\" in our Statement of Faith to mean inerrancy (as\\narticulated in The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy), that the 66 books of the Bible, in their original manuscripts, are without error in all that they afdrm. Scripture is\\nour supreme authority under Christ. (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21; Psalm 12:6; John 17:17)\\nThe Gospel:As evangelicals, we believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The term \"evangelical\" comes from the Greek word euangelion, meaning \"the good news\" or the\\n\"gospel.\" Thus, the evangelical faith focuses on the \"good news\" of salvation brought to sinners through Jesus Christ. We have a biblical mandate to share this good news\\neverywhere. We also understand the language of being \"saved\" in our Statement of Faith to mean that we are saved (i.e., justided) by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ\\nalone, and that true faith will show itself in good works. (Romans 3:21-28; Romans 5:1; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8-10)\\nRace and Ethnicity:Believing in a biblical view of human nature, we afdrm that all people are made in the image of God and are consequently worthy of respect. Scripture also\\nstates that Christ has \"ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and ... made them a kingdom and priests to our God.\" Therefore, we\\nlook at the value of all persons through the lens of biblical truth as image bearers who can have a new identity in Christ. (Genesis 1:26,27; Ephesians 1-2; Revelation 5:9,10)\\nSex and Gender:In afdrming \"traditional family values\" in our Strategic Priorities, we mean what Bible-believing Christians have always meant, and what we have believed as\\nan institution since our founding in 1914, that God created human beings in His image as male and female, that He ordained that marriage is to be between a man (male) and\\na woman (female) for life, and that sexual intimacy is exclusively for marriage. (Genesis 1:26-27; Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; Ephesians 5:22-33; Revelation 19:7-9)\\nThe Church and its Ministries:When we claim to be \"servants of the church,\" we mean what we have always believed since our founding that all our employees -\\nadministration, faculty, staff, and also Trustees - should be committed Bible-believing Christians and true disciples of Jesus (see No. 2). While we recognize the vital role of\\npastors and teachers, we also believe in the priesthood of all believers, where God calls every believer to active ministry as a member of His body, the church, so we hold that\\nevery Christian at CCU (i.e., all employees, from ofdce staff to facilities, to faculty, to the president) should see their jobs as ministries to our students, and that all should live\\nlives of obedience to Christ and His Word. (Matthew 16:18; 28:18-20; Ephesians 4:11-13; 1 Peter 2:9)\\nChrist-centered Higher Education and Truth:In its central convictions, CCU stands in the great tradition of Christian higher education in which education must begin with\\nthe \"fear of the Lord,\" must be rooted in the Scriptures and Jesus Christ (\"in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\"), and must afdrm the truthfulness\\nof truth and the reality of God\\'s created order.

In pursuit of these values, Denver Bible Institute\\'s mission was to \"teach the\\nBible as the Word of God and to train young men and women in the things of the Holy Spirit as they are in Jesus Christ, our Lord.\" The drst classes were held in a rented\\nbuilding with two students and one teacher. God used this humble beginning to start an exciting journey that has given Colorado Christian University the grace to continue\\nstanding for His truth for nearly a century.\\nAs the demand for Christian training grew, Denver Bible Institute was granted a state charter to become a four-year Bible college in 1945 and was renamedDenver Bible\\nCollege. A short time later, the college expanded and developed three main academic schools: the College of Liberal Arts, the Theological School, and the Bible Institute.\\nExpansion continued and within four years Denver Bible College becameRockmont College. Meanwhile, another CCU heritage institution,Western Bible Institute, was\\nfounded by a Denver Bible Institute alumnus in 1948 \"to prepare students for deld ministry.\"\\nIn 1981, Rockmont College was awarded accreditation by the North Central Association, and four years later the school merged with Western Bible Institute to become\\nColorado Christian College. Recognizing the benedts of combining resources to create an ineuential Christian university in Colorado, Colorado Christian College merged\\nwithColorado Baptist Universityand becameColorado Christian Universityin 1989.\\nIn 2021, over 9,200 traditional undergraduate, adult undergraduate, and graduate students enrolled in more than 100 academic programs at Colorado Christian University\\'s\\nmain campus in Lakewood, as well as through our online program and at academic centers in Colorado Springs and Grand Junction. Over 6,200 students enrolled in CCU\\'s\\nDual Credit program in 2021, while attending over 150 partner high schools, including several international schools.\\nThrough the years many things about CCU have changed. Thousands of students have come and gone, the campus facilities have seen countless improvements, new programs\\nhave been launched to train the next generation of Christian leaders, students have gone on mission trips to countries that didn\\'t exist when we were founded, and the\\nUniversity has been blessed by growing enrollments.\\nRecent Campus Updates\\nOver the last decade, we have seen a complete transformation of our campus.\\n• Leprino Hall, opened in 2014, is a 43,000 square foot academic building that dramatically transforms the campus with the addition of 14 classrooms, faculty\\nofdces, a 250-seat community room and restaurant, and casual seating for a community hangout space. Leprino Hall has more than 540 in-class seats\\n• Opened in 2015,Yetter Hallfeatures 53 apartment-style units and optional basement storage. In total, the residence hall is 103,000 square feet and holds 300\\nbeds, with a ratio of 2 beds to 1 full bathroom. Additionally, each unit includes a full kitchen with a living room and a washer and dryer.\\n• Anschutz Student Center, a 60,000 square foot building that features dining, dtness, and ofdce space, was opened in 2017. The Anschutz Student Center\\'s\\nupper eoor is a hangout space for students, including a game room and Student Life and Student Activities ofdces. The main eoor of the student center houses\\nthe Cougar Den, featuring grab-and-go food and additional seating. The Great Room on the main level of the Student Center is a beautiful space, available for\\nmany different gatherings of students and visitors on campus. The wood, stone, and dreplace — combined with the natural daylight — provide an inviting space\\nfor people to gather on campus.\\n• In 2019 CCU openedRockmont Hall, a new 115,000-square-foot residential building named in honor of one of CCU\\'s heritage institutions. The four-story\\nbuilding can house up to 330 undergraduate students and offers a variety of amenities, including eight lounges and common social spaces; a grab-and-go café;\\nand advanced technology, including internet connectivity from each room and Wi-Fi access throughout the facility. All of the student residences are apartment\\nstyle.\\n• TheArmstrong Centeris a 60,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility opened in 2024 that houses the School of Music, an expanded library, features a 500-seat\\nperformance theater, and is home to the University\\'s drst dedicated chapel.\\nOur Commitment throughout our History\\nThrough the years one thing has remained constant: our commitment to a drm foundation that rests on the grace and truth of Christ.

Depending on your goals and stage of life, CCU\\noffers a variety of opportunities to keep your degree program affordable.\\nFor undergrad and graduate students, we provide eexible and cost-effective options to dt your career goals and your life.\\nWe are here to help you explore the possibilities as you discover and pursue your calling at CCU!\\nFinancial Aid for Adult Students\\nFinancial aid for adult students and graduate students is designed to help bridge the gap between college costs (tuition, fees, books, etc.) and what you are able to pay for\\nthose costs. It is important to understand the difference between the types of dnancial aid, as well as research all available options to maximize your investment.\\n• Scholarships— Because scholarships are a type of aid that does not require repayment, you should explore the full range of scholarship opportunities for your\\ndegree program. Adult student scholarships may be offered directly by the college/university, or they may be offered through other venues, such as scholarship\\nsearch engines. (Be sure to visit our list of recommended free scholarship search engines.)\\n• Grants— Similar to scholarships, grants are a type of aid that does not need to be repaid. Grants are typically offered by the government, both federal and state.\\nTo be considered for any type of grant, like a federal Pell Grant, students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as early in their\\ncollege search process as possible. Colorado residents may qualify for additional grants toward their undergraduate degrees.\\n• Education Loans— Students may need to consider borrowing money from a lender to help pay for their education. Education loans are a type of aid that must\\nbe repaid and often come with considerable interest rates, therefore, they should be considered after exploring scholarship programs and grant opportunities.\\nBe sure to research dnancial aid options and available tuition assistance to receive the greatest value for your college investment. Start withApplying for Financial Aid.\\nStretching Your College Investment Dollars\\nIn addition to applying for dnancial assistance, students in our College of Adult and Graduate Studies have access to a range of dnancial aid options that can help reduce\\ncollege costs, depending on their dnancial needs.\\n• If you have already completed college coursework and plan to go back to school, you may be closer to your degree than you think. CCU honors your previous\\naccredited college courseworktoward your completion of an undergraduate degree, as well as offering specidctransfer credit optionsfor Colorado Christian\\nUniversity.

Students are\\nencouraged to apply as early as possible to maximize the possibility of receiving certain grants and loans that have limited funding. Students may submit the FAFSA as early\\nas October 1 for the following award year. Students are encouraged to submit the FAFSA online atstudentaid.gov, and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool when completing the\\nFAFSA. An undergraduate student must provide proof of high school or GED completion before dnancial aid can be disbursed.\\nSome students will be selected by the government for a process known as veridcation. If this happens, the student will need to supply the University with a completed\\nveridcation worksheet and other documents requested. Students are encouraged to dle their federal tax forms early to avoid delays in receiving dnancial aid if they are\\nchosen for veridcation.\\nMost, but not all, federal aid is based on need. A student's dnancial need is determined by federal methodology using information supplied on the FAFSA. Students who do\\nnot qualify for need-based aid may qualify for federal non-need-based loans. The FAFSA form takes into account family size, family income, assets, and the number of family\\nmembers attending college. Exceptional circumstances should be addressed to the Service Central ofdce. All students are encouraged to apply for federal dnancial aid.\\nStudents may request an electronic refund of the credit balance in their CCU account created by the disbursement of dnancial aid.To request an electronic refund, students\\nmust do so by logging into their Self-Service Student Finance account and creating an electronic funds transfer into their individual bank account.\\nFederal Financial Aid\\nColorado Christian University administers the following federal aid programs: the Federal Pell Grant program, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant\\n(FSEOG) program,the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH Grant), the Federal Work-Study program, the Federal Perkins Loan program,\\nthe Federal Direct Stafford Loan program (both subsidized and unsubsidized), and the Federal Direct Plus Loan program.

Applicants for these benedts should access theCCU web pagefor GI Bill® benedts, and\\ncontact information and application forms. Eligible students should keep in mind that benedts may not be received for a number of weeks after enrollment.CCU will not\\nimpose any penalty, or require any borrowed funds, because of a student's inability to meet a dnancial obligation to CCU because of a delayed VA disbursement.CCU may\\nrequire additional payments or dnancial arrangements for amounts that are the difference between the student account charges and the VA benedt disbursement.\\nMaintaining Eligibility for Financial Aid (Satisfactory Academic Progress)\\nTo remain eligible for dnancial aid, a student must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree. For dnancial aid purposes, the University has established the\\nfollowing standards for satisfactory academic progress. Questions about satisfactory academic progress should be referred to the Service Central ofdce.\\n• A student must be enrolled as a regular student seeking a degree, diploma, or license.\\n• An undergraduate student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. A graduate student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Students failing\\nto maintain the minimum cumulative GPA requirements will be put on dnancial aidwarning and must bring their average up to the required standard in the next\\nsemester. Students who do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA requirements will lose their dnancial aid eligibility until the standard is met or the student\\nsuccessfully appeals for an extension, which results ina probationary status.\\n• Students must successfully complete at least two-thirds of the courses they attempt. Courses with grades of W,F , FX, FWor I will remain in the dnancial\\naid credit calculations and are not considered to have been successfully completed but are taken into account in calculating the completion rate. Students\\nfailing to successfully complete two-thirds of the courses they attempt will be put on dnancial aid warning. At the end of thewarning semester, they must have\\nsuccessfully completed two-thirds ofall courses attemptedor they will become ineligible to receive dnancial aid. The ineligibility will continue until they meet\\nthe standard or successfully appeal for an extension, which will result in a probationary status.\\n• Students will no longer be eligible to receive federal, state, and/or institutional dnancial aid once they have attempted 150% of the number of credits needed\\nto complete their degree, as stated in the CCUAcademic catalog.All terms in which a student is enrolled count toward the maximum time frame, even if the\\nstudent withdraws from the school. Terms of enrollment in which no aid is received will count toward the maximum time frame. Transfer credits will also be\\nincluded in this calculation.\\n• Students who are on dnancial aid probation have one semester to comply with the academic progress policy. This includes meeting both the dnancial aid\\ncompletion rate and the cumulative GPA standard of their respective program. Those who do not will be ineligible to receive dnancial aid.\\n• Undergraduate students in the College of Adult and Graduate Studies who earn two or more F and/or FWgrades in their drst semester of enrollment at CCU will\\nbe ineligible to receive dnancial aid for subsequent semesters. Students will have the opportunity to submit an appeal. Appeals will be reviewed by the Financial\\nAid Committee. The decision of the committee is dnal.\\n• A student is allowed to repeat a passed course one time and still be eligible to receive dnancial aid for the repeated course. If a student repeats the course a\\nsecond time, dnancial aid cannot be used to pay for the course. The student's dnancial aid will be adjusted to reeect a lower number of credits that are eligible.\\nStudents will need to pay for the repeated course from their own resources.\\n• Students may repeat a failed course until it is passed and be eligible for dnancial aid.Once a student has completed any course with a passing grade, the student\\nis eligible for only one additional retake of the course, regardless if the repeat of the passed course results in a failing grade.\\nBecause real progress in an academic program is of greatest concern, students are evaluated for eligibility every semester, whether or not dnancial aid has been received.\\nStudents who become ineligible for federal dnancial aid may appeal the decision with the Financial Aid Committee. The ruling of that committee is dnal.\\nUndergraduate students are required to take a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester in order to qualify for federal dnancial aid, except for provisions in the Federal Pell\\nGrant Program that will allow less than half-time students to receiveaP ell Grant. However, once students have received their drst undergraduate baccalaureate degree, they\\nno longer qualify to receive a Federal Pell Grant.\\nGraduate students are required to take a minimum of 3 credit hours per semester in order to qualify for dnancial aid. Graduate students are not eligible to receiveaF ederal\\nPell Grant.\\nHow to Apply for Federal and State Aid\\n• Apply for admission. Entering students cannot be candidates for dnancial aid until they have been admitted.\\n• Complete and submit the FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA forms via the Internet atstudentaid.gov. Students are encouraged to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool when\\ncompleting the FAFSA.\\n• The student may receive requests for additional information or documentation. To help expedite the application, students should promptly submit the requested\\ninformation.\\nApplications for dnancial aid should be submitted prior to the beginning of the semester.

CUS consists of six schools: School of Business and Leadership, School of Education, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Music, School\\nof Science and Engineering, and the School of Theology.\\nTheCollege of Adult and Graduate Studies (CAGS), also referred to asCCU Online, is designed for non-traditional undergraduate students or graduate students and meets the\\nneeds of working adults and graduate students. Most CAGS programs are fully online, however, certain programs have an on-campus component at the Lakewood campus\\nor the Colorado Springs campus. CAGS consists of six schools: School of Biblical and Theological Studies, School of Behavioral and Social Sciences, School of Business and\\nTechnology, School of Counseling, School of Education Professions, and the School of Nursing and Health Professions.\\nTheCCU Academy offers high school students an opportunity to earn dual credit via partner high schools or through online dual enrollment courses taught by CCU professors.\\nStudents may earn an Associate of Arts degree through the CCU Academy.\\nAcademic Policies\\nClassiUcation of Students\\nStudents are classided according to their objective, level, load, and progress.\\nObjective: A regular student is working toward a degree or certidcation and must meet all standard requirements for admission. A non-degree or special studentis not\\nworking toward a degree or certidcation but selects courses to meet personal interests.\\nLevel: Students working toward an associate or bachelor degree are classided as undergraduate-level students. Students working toward a graduate degree (Master’s or\\nDoctorate) are classided as graduate-level students. Students seeking certidcates or licensure may be classided as either undergraduate- or graduate-level students.\\nLoad:For students enrolled in the traditional/residential undergraduate programs, students taking 12 or more credit hours per semester are classided as full-time students;\\nthose taking 6-11 credit hours are classided as half-time students; and those taking 1-5 credit hours are classided as less than half-time students.\\nCourse load varies depending on program of study and personal choice.

Students averaging 15 hours per semester and following\\nrecommended sequencing of courses will usually be able to complete their programs within the time recommended. Select degree programs require more than 120 total\\ncredits and can require additional time. Late changes to the major or adding multiple programs can also add extra requirements. Specidc load limits apply:\\n• Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or above may take a maximum of 21 credits per semester.\\n• Students without a CCU GPA (new freshmen and transfer students) may take a maximum of 18 credits.\\n• Students with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 to 3.49 may take a maximum of 18 credits per semester unless the student is on probation or conditionally admitted.\\nCredits past the normal course load (12-18 credits) have additional charges. Please reference the CUSdnancial aid web pagefor current tuition and fee information.\\nCAGS Undergraduate Programs\\nNew undergraduate students admitted to CAGS in good standing may enroll in no more than 15 credit hours their drst semester at CCU. New undergraduate students\\nadmitted in good standing may not exceed more than 3 credit hours in their drst registered block at CCU. Students receiving military Tuition Assistance, VA benedts,\\nor Vocational Rehab benedts may enroll in no more than 6 credit hours in their drst registered block at CCU.\\nContinuing undergraduate students may not exceed 18 credits hours without override approval from the Dean of their respective program. Students may not exceed9 credit\\nhours concurrently in any block without prior approval.\\nCAGS academic standing policy imposes a maximum of9 semester credits for students on probation. Courses cannot be taken concurrently; probation students are limited\\nto one course per block.\\nCAGS Graduate Programs\\nGraduate students in good standing may not exceed 12 credit hours in any given semester without override approval from the Dean of their respective program. Students\\nmay not exceed 6 credit hours concurrently in any block.\\nCAGS academic standing policy imposes a maximum of nine semester credits for students on probation. Courses cannot be taken concurrently; probation students are\\nlimited to one course per block.\\nUndergraduate Students Taking Graduate Level Courses\\nUndergraduate students are eligible to take master-level courses (500-600) only if the course is part of their undergraduate degree program. Master’s-level courses are\\nnumbered 500 and 600, and doctoral-level courses are numbered 700.\\nRequired Course Sequence and Prerequisites (CAGS)\\nThe CAGS undergraduate programs require certain introductory courses to be completed as the drst courses to be completed in a degree plan. Specidc program\\nrequirements, sequences, and credits transferred can impact this course sequence. Enrollment Counselors (EC) or Student Service Advisors (SSA) will provide details for\\nstudents to help plan the initial course sequence.\\nPrerequisites are intended to prepare students for the successful completion of advanced courses. Failure to complete a prerequisite will prevent a student from continuing\\nin a predetermined sequence. It is the student's responsibility to work closely with their SSA to ensure prerequisites have been completed and sequence is taken in order.\\nCohort and Course Sequence in CAGS\\nA cohort is the sequential order of courses to be taken within a degree, certidcate, or program. Certain requirements must be met in order for a cohort to begin. Graduate\\nstudents begin their cohort sequence immediately upon enrollment.

For example, a student cannot\\ncomplete a calculus course and then receive credit for college algebra or precalculus. For questions about which courses may be considered backward progression, please\\nconsult the University Registrar. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Dean over the course and the University Registrar.\\nDeUnition of a Credit Hour\\nColorado Christian University uses the U.S. Department of Education's credit hour dednition, the Carnegie Unit, as its measurement for student workload. Credit hours\\nare based on the achievement of student learning objectives demonstrated in the quality of work as dedned by the criteria established in each course for assessing student\\nwork. Based upon the Carnegie Unit dednition of a credit hour, we estimatethat students would engage in 15 hours of direct instruction and 30 hours of indirect instruction\\nper credit hour earned. For example, in an online three-credit course, the range would be 112-135 hours of time spent on a combination of direct instruction and indirect\\ninstruction. In an on-campus semester of 16 weeks, a three-credit course will include a minimum of 45 hours of in-class or direct faculty instruction AND a minimum of 90\\nhours of out-of-class student work. Other academic activities that measure student workload tied to a credit hour, such as laboratory work, internships, andpractica, also\\nrequire the minimum total equivalent number of hours per credit earned.\\nAcademic DeUnitions\\nMajor\\nA major is an academic program designed to enable students to acquire mastery of a particular discipline or interdisciplinary area. Baccalaureate majors at CCU consist of a\\nminimum of 30 credit hours, with at least 15 credit hours at the 300 level or above. The total number of courses a baccalaureate program may require at any level in the major\\nand related departments is no more than 72 credit hours, unless a program requires otherwise for specidc reasons. Students must complete a minimum of 50 percent of the\\nmajor coursework at Colorado Christian University.\\nIndividually Designed Major (CUS Only)\\nIndividually designed major enable students to gain experience not otherwise available to them while benedting from the biblical studies and Christian environment offered\\nto residential students. Designed majors must be approved by the Dean of the School where most credits will be taken and by the University Registrar. A designed major must\\ninclude a minimum of30 credit hours but not more than 72 credit hours from the major or majors offered at CCU, and at least 15 credit hours in the major must be from\\n300-level courses or higher. The full general education program is expected in addition to the designed major, which is 48 credit hours and includes a dxed list of courses. The\\nproposal for a designed major must include a list of course requirements for the major—including no more than 9 credits of graduate level courses—and a detailed explanation\\nindicating why an existing major or combination of majors/minors cannot meet the educational objectives of the student.\\nTo provide courses in disciplines not offered in the University curriculum, Colorado Christian University occasionally works in cooperation with other educational\\ninstitutions, and these credit hours may count toward the 30-credit minimum, as long as no more than 50% of the major consists of courses from an institution other than\\nCCU.\\nDouble Majors and Double Degrees\\nTo earn a second (or additional) major, the student must complete all course requirements of each major including any foundational courses. Within the second and any\\nsubsequent majors, there must be a minimum of 24 non-duplicated credits in each. Students may utilize the courses of the second (or additional) major to fuldll the elective\\nrequirements of the drst major. If the double majors are the same degree (i.e. Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science), a student receives one bachelor's degree with two\\nseparate disciplines. Majors completed in two different degrees (B.A. and B.S.) will be awarded both degrees.\\nMinor\\nA minor is an academic program that a student completes in an academic area other than that of the declared major. Minors require a minimum of 18 credit hours, 50% of\\nwhich must be completed at CCU unless a program’s requirements specify otherwise, and 50% of which must not overlap with the major or other minor. A minimum of 6\\ncredit hours must be at the 300 level or higher. In addition, students must complete any required prerequisites of the courses in the minor. Students may add—as applicable\\nto their school and program—a minor to any major in their bachelor’s degree, as long as the major and minor are not duplicated. Students may not declare a minor in the same\\nspecidc discipline in which they are earning a major (for example, an English major and an English minor are prohibited).\\nIndividually Designed Minors (CUS Only)\\nDesigned minors must be approved by the Dean of the School where most credits will be taken and by the University Registrar. A designed minor must have a minimum of\\n18 total credit hours with a minimum of 6 credits at the 300 level or higher. Fifty percent of the designed minor must be completed at CCU, and 50% of its content must not\\noverlap with the major or other minor. The proposal for a designed minor must include a list of course requirements for the minor and a detailed explanation indicating why\\nan existing minor or combination of majors/minors cannot meet the educational objectives of the student. Students may add—as applicable to their school and program—a\\nminor to any major in their bachelor’s degree, as long as the major and minor are not duplicated. Students may not declare a minor in the same specidc discipline in which they\\nare earning a major (for example, an English major and an English minor are prohibited).\\nEmphasis or the Cross-Disciplinary Study\\nAn emphasis or a cross-disciplinary study (CDS) is a focused academic course of study that augments a student’s declared major in preparation for career goals or continuing\\neducation. An emphasis/CDS requires a minimum of 12 credit hours, 75% of which must be completed at CCU, and 75% of which must not overlap with the major, minor, or\\nother emphasis. A minimum of 3 credit hours must be at the 300 level or higher.

Enrollment requires the approval of the Dean or director under whose department the course is offered.\\nAn Independent or Directed Study must be concluded within the term/semester.\\nInternship, Field Experience, Practicum, Thesis\\nInternships, student teaching, deld experience, practicum, and theses are used to fuldll specidc requirements of degree programs. Field experience courses and student\\nteachingpracticagenerally do not extend beyond a regular semester. A thesis or internship maye xtend beyond a regular semester provided a formal course extension has\\nbeen approved. Requirements for these courses are outlined in the course syllabus and students are supervised by University faculty.\\nInternships are available to juniors and seniors; a sophomore may enroll for an internship only with the approval of the Dean. Some internships may be graded traditionally\\nand some are graded pass/fail. Consult the course description for the specidc grading used for each course.Field experience does not extend beyond a regular semester.A\\npracticum, thesis, or internship mayextend beyond a regular semester as long as the specidc dates are given on the Course Extension form. A grade of I(Incomplete) will be\\nassigned during the extension period, which is reeected by a CIP(Course in Progress) on the student's transcript. A deld experience, practicum, or thesis is graded on the\\nstandard A-F grading scale. Requirements for these courses are outlined in the course syllabus and students are closely supervised by University faculty.\\nTeaching Assistantship Credit in the College of Undergraduate Studies\\nIn the College of Undergraduate Studies, students with at least a junior standing and a GPA of 3.0 in their major may,b y faculty invitation, become a teaching assistant (TA)\\nfor a course. Students who are considered for a TA position must have completed the course for which they will be a TA. When the student declines to receive credit for this\\nwork, TAs will not receive credit for the course or section for which they are a TA and will not be paid. The Teaching Assistantship will be listed on the student's transcript as 0\\nor 1 credit and is graded as Pass/Fail. A student may be a TA (0 or 1 credit) for a maximum of two courses or two sections of the same course per semester. They may receive\\na maximum of four TA credits toward the bachelor's degree. TA responsibilities may include activities such as: assisting the supervising faculty in preparation of lectures;\\npresenting course material to a class while the faculty member of record is in attendance; grading objective tests and examinations; posting grades in a learning management\\nsystem, e.g. Blackboard; proctoring exams; videotaping presentations; helping students research a topic for a paper and/or presentation. TA's may not grade essays, term\\npapers, or other non-objective assignments. Most majors restrict the use of Teaching Assistantship credit to satisfy major course requirements. TA credit is a billable credit\\nas established by University policy.\\nCo-Curricular Credit in the College of Undergraduate Studies\\nElective credit may be earned for various co-curricular activities, including intercollegiate athletics, student government, theatre, and musical ensembles. No more than 10\\nhours of co-curricular credit will count toward a degree program. Some school departments may restrict co-curricular credits. See the Dean of the particular school for\\ndetails. Training and participation in varsity intercollegiate team sports may be taken for credit only once per academic year per varsity sport. A maximum of 4 credit hours\\nper sport may be counted toward graduation requirements.\\nNon-Degree Seeking Students\\nNon-degree seeking students are students who are not working toward a degree or certidcation, but who select courses to meet personal interests.Non-degree seeking\\nstudents, other than certidcate students, wanting to take graduate-level courses must gain approval from the appropriate Academic Dean. Permission to enroll in graduate\\ncourses as a non-degree seeking student does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program. Students must be enrolled as a regular student seeking a degree,\\ndiploma or licensure to qualify for federal dnancial aid programs.\\nAttendance Policies\\nAttendance in the College of Undergraduate Studies\\nStudents are required to abide by the attendance policies stated in each course syllabus. Each course should have a stated number of allowed absences. The University\\nconsiders absences excused if:\\n• There is a legitimate personal or immediate family illness (nurse or physician's written notidcation is required).\\nColorado Christian University\\n48 / 1000\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Arrangements should be made with the professor\\neither prior to the planned absence or immediately following an absence due to illness. Absences in excess of the allowed absences in each course will result in a reduction of\\ngrade as determined by the course professor and as noted in the syllabus.\\nAttendance in CAGS\\nAttendance and promptness are essential for student learning; for personal and small-group relationships; and for the accomplishment of learning outcomes.Additionally,\\nattendance is essential to comply with government regulations for Federal Financial Aid, Veterans Administration (VA) benedts, accreditation standards, and other\\nscholarships.\\nIn an on-site class session, attendance is dedned as the physical presence in the session.\\nClass session attendance for online courses is demonstrated by continual active participation in discussions and assignment submissions (including quizzes and exams) by\\nthe due dates listed in the course shell. The associated grading rubric provides guidelines for active participation. Students are responsible for reviewing rubrics prior to\\nbeginning course assignments. Failure to fuldll these requirementswithin the parameters of each week/sessionmay result in being dropped from the course.\\nIf a student does not submit an assignment or participate in a graded discussion during the drst eight days of class, the student will be administratively dropped from the\\ncourse and any future course registrations for the current semester.P articipation prior to the course start date will not count toward course attendance and participation\\nrequirements.\\nIf at any point in the course, a student does not submit an assignment or participate in a graded discussion for 14 consecutive days they will receive a failing withdrawal\\n(FW) grade and will no longer be enrolled in the course, and administratively dropped from any future course registrations for the current semester. Individual assignment\\nextensions do not supersede the Attendance policy. Students with approved Course Extensions must still meet the Course Attendance policy through the end date of the\\ncourse. Students who fail the course and do not participate in the last week of the course will receive a grade of FW.\\nNote: attendance is not required during week-long breaks. However, the Late Assignment policy is still applicable for past-due assignments.\\nGrading Policies\\nGrading System\\nThe University uses a four-point system to calculate semester and cumulative GPAs.\\nChange of Grades\\nThe Change of Grade form allows faculty to correct grades inaccurately recorded on the student’s academic record. Requests for grade changes must be submitted by the\\nassigning faculty member by the end of the semester following the conclusion of the course. Unless a student has submitted an extension request prior to the completion of\\nthe course and has been granted this extension, course work submitted after the dnal day of class cannot count toward the student’s grade.\\nAcademic Appeals Policy for CAGS\\nAcademic appeals provide a timely and equitable resolution of problems or complaints of an academic nature when reasonable and/or direct discussion between the parties\\nhave failed to do so.Please see the Academic Appeals section in theCAGS Student Handbookfor details concerning the appeal process.\\nAcademic Appeals Policy for CUS\\nThe process for students to appeal grades:\\n1. The student will request in writing that the faculty member reconsider the grade that was given;\\n2. The student may appeal in writing to the Dean of the appropriate school before the end of the semester following the one in which the grade was assigned;\\n3. Within 10 days of the Dean's decision, the student may submit a written appeal of the Dean's decision to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\\n4. The process for students to appeal other academic decisions:\\n5. The student will submit a written appeal to the Dean of the appropriate school before the end of the semester following the one in which the decision was made;\\n6. Within 10 days of the Dean's decision, the student may submit a written appeal of the Dean's decision to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism\\nIt is particularly important for Colorado Christian University students to adhere to the highest ethical and moral standards, including exemplary standards of academic\\nconduct.\\nAs a community seeking to liveb y the truth of Jesus Christ, CCU values personal integrity and academic honesty as vital components of a Christian educational experience.\\nThe University believes that trust among community members is essential for both high-quality scholarship and the effective operation of the University. As members of this\\ncommunity, it is CCU’s policy that all students, faculty, staff, and administrators are equally responsible for their personal behavior and their academic integrity. Offenses will\\nbe documented. Ignorance of the academic integrity policy is not an excuse.\\nExamples of Academic Dishonesty\\n• To steal or use another’s work and pass it off as one’s own\\n• To copy and paste text from a website without attempting to cite the source\\n• To use another’s production without crediting the source\\n• To commit literary theft\\n• To present, as new and original, an idea or product derived from an existing source\\n• To copy ideas and/or direct quotes from a source such that it makes up a signidcant portion of your work\\n• To intentionally change words but to copy the sentence structure of a source without giving credit\\nColorado Christian University\\n49 / 1000\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For students taking exams either remotely or in-seat, you must refrain from using\\nany unauthorized assistance, materials, or devices during the exam. An attempt to communicate with others, access unauthorized resources, or engage in cheating will be\\nconsidered in violation of the academic integrity policy.\\nSelf-Plagiarism\\nSelf-plagiarism is the act of using part or all of an assignment you submitted in another course without permission from your current instructor or without citing your work\\ncorrectly. This applies to previously attempted CCU courses and courses at other institutions. If granted permission, student’s work must be cited according to the writing\\nstandard being used in the course (e.g. APA or Turabian).\\nAcademic Integrity: Plagiarism Procedures\\nFaculty will hold students accountable through the use of plagiarism detection tools (such as SafeAssign, Grammarly, etc.) to maintain academic integrity. When a faculty\\nmember has reason to believe that a student has been academically dishonest or that an assignment has been plagiarized, the faculty member will use the report generated\\nby plagiarism detection tools to determine if the assignment needs to be submitted to Academic Affairs to be reviewed by the Dean of the School that the student is enrolled\\nin.\\n1) If the faculty member determines there is sufdcient evidence to conclude that the student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the following will be applied:\\na) Faculty members will privately email the student with evidence of the questionable behavior, such as a report generated from SafeAssign, and refer the student to the\\nacademic integrity policy. The incident will then be submitted to Academic Affairs, and the Dean of the school that the student is enrolled in. If the academic Dean determines\\na violation in academic integrity the student will receive a “0” (zero) grade for the assignment, and the incident will be recorded as the student’s drst plagiarism offense.\\nb) The second offense will result in a failure of the course; Faculty members will follow the protocol listed above. The academic Dean will determine if a second violation has\\noccurred. If so, the academic Dean will notify the student of the failure. This incident will be recorded in the student’s dle as a second offense.\\nc) The third offense will result in a failure of the course and suspension from the University. As mentioned above, the assignment will be reviewed by the academic Dean to\\ndetermine if a third offense has occurred. If so, the academic Dean will notify the student of the failure and suspension.\\nd) Should a readmitted student who was suspended for plagiarism be reinstated and plagiarize for a fourth offense, they will be expelled from the University.\\n2) If the academic Dean is also the faculty member of the course, the process will be handled by an academic Dean appointed by the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\\nNote: If a student wants to appeal the decision regarding a plagiarism offense, they must follow the Final Course Grade Appeal process (p. 30).\\nArtiUcial Intelligence Usage Framework\\nThroughout CCU courses, the use of AI generative tools is limited. CCU provided AI tools are used to improve student-generated work rather than to replace student-\\ngenerated work. Student- generated work is dedned as any product created independently by students that demonstrates their knowledge and understanding of a subject.\\nThis includes essays, audio or photographic dles, videos, portfolios, or other content meant to demonstrate students’ critical thinking and academic understanding.\\nAcceptable Use of Generative AI\\nStudents may use CCU-provided AI tools including Grammarly,Turnitin, and PERRLA to augment your writing process. These tools are not considered generative AI tools\\nand are acceptable. Generative AI tools such as Chat GPT, Gemini, etc. may be used within the following guidelines. Students can use generative AI to:\\n• Brainstorm and explore new topics/ideas.\\n• Explore potential counterarguments/opposing points of view. If generative AI is used to brainstorm and explore, the content must be paraphrased and cited.\\nUn-acceptable Use of Generative AI\\nStudents may not use any AI tool to generate any portions of your writing, for example:\\n• Students may not retype or cut and paste the assignment prompt into a generative AI tool to produce material.\\n• Students may not place your work into a generative AI tool for rewrite or paraphrasing.\\n• Students may not place another’s work into a generative AI tool for rewrite.\\nDisciplinary Action for Un-acceptable Generative AI Usage\\nAll instances of suspected unacceptable Generative AI Usage will be reported to the respective Academic Dean. The Dean will make a determination based on evidence, and\\nif it is found that the student has used Generative AI in an unacceptable manner, then a grade of zero will be given for the assignment.\\nAcademic Integrity:\\nSanction Terms Dedned\\n· Fail assignment means the student receives no points.\\n· Fail course means the student receives an “FX” grade.\\n· Suspension means the student is withdrawn from the University and receives “FX” grades for the course(s) in which the violations occurred. The student will be\\nadministratively dropped from all registered courses and cannot reenroll for at least 365 days (from the start 42 date of the last course enrolled).

Pursuant to these laws, no qualided individual with a disability shall unlawfully be denied access to or participation in services, programs, or\\nactivities at the University. The University will attempt to provide reasonable accommodation to qualided individuals to the extent that it is readily achievable to do so. CCU\\nis unable, however, to make accommodations that are unduly burdensome or that fundamentally alter the nature of the program, service, or activity. More information can\\nbe found on the CCU website here:https://www.ccu.edu/accommodations/.\\nIn matters of vital importance to the student's relationship with the institution, an ofdcial summons for a conference may be originated by an administrative ofdce or a faculty\\nmember. An ofdcial summons will be delivered in writing. A student who neglects or disregards an ofdcial summons for a conference may be subject to suspension.\\nEarly Final Examinations for Students in the College of Undergraduate Studies\\nThe dnal examinations for the College of Undergraduate Studies are given during the dnal week of each semester.A dnal examination scheduleis published online each\\nsemester and is available at the time of registration. The professor of the academic course determines the most effective and appropriate assessment of course content, such\\nas comprehensivee xamination, research project, oral presentation, or other performance-based demonstration. Students are required to attend the regularly scheduled\\ncourse dnal for each class in which he or she is enrolled. If the professor requires an assessment activity at a different time or venue, this information will be included in\\nthe course syllabus and the student is required to attend. Under certain circumstances, individual students will be granted permission to reschedule a dnal examination or\\nassessment activity through an application submitted to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. The application form is available on theOfdce of Academic Affairs Connect\\npageor fromthestudent'sLife Directions Center advisor.\\nStudents may apply to reschedule a dnal examination when faced with an emergency situation, unforeseen circumstance, veridable University-sponsored or approved\\nevents, and mission-sponsored or educational programs.A student who has three or more examinations scheduled on one day may apply to reschedule one exam at a later\\ndate. Travel convenience andpersonal vacation plans or commitments do not constitute reasons to reschedule.\\nAcademic Policies\\nTranscripts\\nA CCU transcript is a comprehensive record of a student's academic progress at Colorado Christian University, and the University's certided statement of the student's\\nacademic record, including coursework, grades, and degrees earned.The transcript includes all degrees, majors, minors, emphases, certidcates, cross-disciplinary studies,\\nlicenses, and any applicable academic honors conferred with their respective date. Transcripts do not include honors or merits obtained at previous institutions, nor\\nextracurricular activities that bear no academic credit.\\nOfdcial transcripts will be provided upon request through CCU's online ordering system (Parchment). Electronic transcripts should be ordered when possible to ensure\\ntimely processing. Unofdcial transcripts for current students may be obtained throughStudent Planningat no charge. For additional transcript information, including the\\nordering process, go to theTranscript Requestweb page.\\nDiplomas\\nStudent names are printed on the diploma as requested on the graduation application. Degrees are conferred throughout the year upon veridcation that allprogram\\nrequirements have been completed. The diploma includes the student's name, degree, major, and academic honors. The diploma does not include any minors, emphases, or\\ncross-disciplinary studies. With the conferral of the degree, a student will receive one diploma. Additional copies are available for afee and can be orderedhere. Students\\nshould allow up to 10 weeks following degree conferral to receive the diploma. CCU also provides a digital version of the student's diploma for undergraduate and master’s\\nlevel diplomas.\\nLetters of Completion\\nSince degrees are conferred upon veridcation that all program requirements have been completed, letters of completion are no longer provided. Students can order an ofdcial\\ntranscript to provide evidence of completing their program requirements.\\nInformation on ordering transcripts and replacement diplomas can be found online atwww.ccu.edu/transcript.\\nNotice of Privacy Rights of Students (FERPA)\\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 is designed to protect the privacy of education records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review\\ntheir records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Students have the right to dle complaints\\nwith the FERPA ofdce concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the act.

Students are expected to register for courses each\\nsemester until graduation. Deadlines for registration are listed online in the academic calendar and in the student handbook. Students are responsible for making themselves\\naware of all deadlines that apply to them. Regular deadline notidcations are found inCCU Connectstudent portal announcements.\\nAdding and Dropping/Withdrawing from Courses in CUS\\nOn-campus students may add or drop courses online (usingStudent Planning) during add/drop periods or by consultingtheir Faculty/Life Directions Center\\nadvisor. Deadlines for adding and dropping courses are listed in theCUS Academic Calendarand in thestudent handbook. Students are responsible for condrming course\\nschedule changes made at the time of submission. Refunds are made on the basis of the schedule in the Financial Information section of this catalog. When students drop just\\none or two courses, refunds will only apply when the remaining credits are below the block tuition rates (12-18 hours) or a student drops a class in the overload category.\\nUnless a course is ofdcially dropped, charges will continue since the student remains enrolled.\\nIn CUS, a grade of W (Withdraw) is assigned to courses dropped after the Wednesday of the second week of the fall and spring terms and before the thirteenth week. After\\nthe start of the thirteenth week, the grade earned is assigned. Students who unofdcially withdraw from a course after the Add/Drop deadline (and before the Withdrawal\\ndeadline) will receive a grade of FW (Unauthorized Withdrawal) and charges will remain on the student's account.\\nStudents who are not registered for a course will not be permitted to attend classes or participate in academic coursework.\\nAdding and Dropping/Withdrawing from Courses in CAGS\\nThe deadline to register for a course is 11:59 p.m. (MT) on the start date of the course, according toSelf-Service. Students are not able to register for a course after the ofdcial\\nstart date. Students who drop a course (intentionally or unintentionally) after the start date may not be re-added to the course for that block.\\nRegardless of the registration date, students must be prepared to complete course requirements once the course begins. Failure to complete assignments due to registration\\ndate does not automatically qualify for a course or due date extension.\\nRegistration opens for a semester at least two months prior to the start date of that semester. Registering early allows students the optimum selection of courses as well as\\nsufdcient time to prepare for their courses. This includes accessing course materials, reviewing course syllabi, acquiring computer access, etc.\\nWhile Student Service Advisors (SSAs) are available to help with registration, responsibility for selecting and registering courses on a timely basis ultimately rests with each\\nstudent. Students have full access to their program evaluation inSelf-Serviceto help with this process.\\nThe deadline to drop a dve-week, seven-week, eight-week, or ten-week course is the course's second Monday (the eighth day of the course) at 11:59 p.m. (MT). For semester-\\nlong courses, the drop deadline is the fourth Monday of the course (twenty-drst day of the course) at 11:59 p.m. (MT). For residency courses, the drop deadline is the course's\\ndrst day of the residency at 11:59pm. Residency course fees are non-refundable.\\nCourses may be dropped usingSelf-Service. Course drops are processed in real-time and students are responsible for condrming that the drop has been processed. If a course\\nis dropped after its ofdcial start date, students cannot re-register for the course in that block.\\nCourses must be dropped before the drop deadline in order to receive a full reversal of tuition and fees.Students are dnancially and academically responsible for any course(s)\\nnot dropped by the drop deadline. Reference the Course Withdrawal section in theCAGS Student Handbookfor more information.\\nChange of Major and Catalog Year\\nStudents who enroll in the University are allowed to graduate under the academic requirements in the catalog published at the time of their initial enrollment or selection\\nof a major, as long as students have maintained continuous enrollment. Students who are not enrolled for more than 12 months must apply for readmission and complete\\na degree program under the regulations publishedin the catalog that is in effect at the time of re-enrollment. Students who change their major will complete the degree\\nprogram under the catalog in effect at the time they changed their major. A change of program may occur during a semester if all courses the student is currently takingapply\\nto the new program. Otherwise, the change of major will be made at the end of the semester. Please consult with your Advisor for more details.\\nStudents who modify any part of their academic program (including major, emphasis, minor, etc.) will be updated to the current catalog.\\nDual Use of Courses in CAGS\\nWithin certain degree programs, some courses may serve dual purposes within the general education required core and the major core requirements. However, in order to\\nuphold the integrity of our programs, this option is limited to dfteen credit hours total. Examples of courses that can be used in both the general education section and the\\nfoundation/major areas are: HUM 425A, BUS 105A, MKT 205A, ECO 220A, and select psychology courses. If a student elects to utilize these courses in both areas, they must\\nensure that they have completed sufdcient electives to maintain the full 120 credits for degree completion.\\nUndergraduate students may complete a maximum of twelve credits of 500 level education courses in their major for a bachelor's degree and use the same credits to fuldll\\nrequirements in a Master's degree. Undergraduate students are only eligible to take graduate-level courses if the course is part of their undergraduate degree program.\\nStudents who have earned EDU 500-level courses completed in an undergraduate education degree may be applied to the graduate degree if they have been completed\\nwithin dvey ears. Grades earned for graduate-level courses taken as part of an undergraduate degree program are calculated with the student's undergraduate cumulative\\ngrade point average (GPA) and are not factored into the student's graduate program GPA. Graduate-level tuition pricing is applicable for all graduate-level courses.\\nDual Use of Courses in CUS\\nStudents must be enrolled in a Dual Degree program (approved undergraduate programs that include several graduate courses) to take courses on the graduate level. Grades\\nearned for graduate-level courses taken as part of an undergraduate degree program are calculated with the student's undergraduate cumulative grade point average (GPA)\\nand are not factored into the student's graduate program GPA.

Nursing students may only repeat a nursing major course if it is not passed successfully on the drst\\nattempt.When the course is repeated, both courses and their grades are shown on the transcript, but only the last grade received will be used in calculating the cumulative\\nGPA. If the same grade is earned twice, only one grade will be used to calculate the GPA. The student must pay full tuition for repeated courses. For information on dnancial\\naid eligibility for repeated courses, see the \"Financial Aid Eligibility-Repeated Courses\" section of theFinancial Aid Handbook.\\nAdditional Requirements for Repeating Courses\\nStudents are only allowed to repeat a course one time (grades of W/FW do not apply to this count).To take a course for a third time, a petition for academic exception should\\nbe completed noting changes that will be made so the student can complete the course successfully. There are occasional exceptions for CCU dual credit students who may\\nwant to repeat a course with a grade of B+ or higher because of length of time between that high school course and a further prerequisite in college or for graduate or medical\\nschool purposes. A student\\'s advisor and the CCU Registrar will decide when this exception can be approved. When approved, the repeated course will replace the dual credit\\ncourse.\\nFor the dnancial aid implications of repeated courses, please contact Financial Aid. Additionally, this policy does not apply to courses that are designated as repeatable.\\nRepeatable courses can be used to earn credits in multiple semesters, and therefore,the grades earned cannot be replaced. Examples of designated repeatable courses\\ninclude select music courses (i.e., lessons, ensembles, etc.) as well as internships and HPEcredits.\\nCourse Repeat Exception for Education Students\\nEducation students are required to complete ECE/EDU/SED 414A Field II in proximity to ECE/EDU/SED 480A Student Teaching. For education students who are suspended\\nor take a leave of absence, Field II may need to be repeated, regardless of the grade received, if it has been 5 or more semesters since Field II was completed. Students\\nreturning to complete a Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction (MACI) may also need to repeat coursework earned prior to 2010.Please see theCurriculum and\\nInstruction, MA (CAGS)program page for more information.\\nChange of Major Between Colleges at CCU\\nEach of the three academic divisions—CUS, CAGS, and CCU Academy—have distinct admissions requirements which prevent students from simply changing majors when\\nswitching from one college to another. Students who seek to switch colleges must submit an application and work with their Enrollment Counselor to review options and\\nchange majors between the colleges.\\nChange of Majors within a College at CCU\\nMost students who seek to change majors within their current college at CCU can do so by submitting a Change of Major form; however, admission into the following majors/\\nprograms from a different major/program will require a new application or additional paperwork:\\nCAGS Graduate Programs:\\n• School of Counseling\\n• School of Education Professions\\n• School of Nursing and Health Professions\\nCAGS Undergraduate Programs:\\n• School of Education Professions\\n• School of Nursing and Health Professions\\nOn Campus Undergraduate Programs:\\n• School of Music\\n• School of Nursing and Health Professions\\nEnrollment Restrictions Between Colleges at CCU\\nLimits on CUS Students Registering for CAGS Courses\\nStudents at sophomore standing or higher who are completing a program as a traditional student within the College of Undergraduate Studies (CUS) may, upon matriculation\\ninto CUS, take 15 hours additional hours of CAGS undergraduate credit. If a student is in a graduate dual enrollment program, graduate credits are in addition to these 15\\nhours of undergraduate credit. CUS programs that require CAGS undergraduate courses are limited to 9 hours of CAGS undergraduate courses in addition to those required\\nby the program.\\nStudents completing programs in CUS should register for courses offered on the \"Main Campus\" (MC) that have section numbers in the 01, 02, 03, 04 series. Courses with\\nsection numbers such as 15001, A7001, etc. or with course numbers ending in \"A\" indicate an offering in the College of Adult and Graduate Studies. Students should work with\\ntheir LDC advisor to understand which CUS requirements are met through CAGS courses.CUS students enrolled in CAGS courses follow the standards and expectations of\\nthe policies and procedures of the College of Adult and Graduate Studies.\\nCUS students are only allowed to take CAGS graduate courses that are speci;cally required by their program. Any additional graduate courses not required by the program require a\\nspecial petition and approval from the CAGS Dean.\\nLimits on CAGS Students Registering for CUS Courses\\nStudents enrolled in CAGSprograms may be approved to take no more than6 credits from CUS during their time at CCU.

They will also be given information concerning the appeal process and\\npotential future reinstatement process.\\nSuspension Appeals\\nStudents are given the opportunity to appeal an academic suspension if therewere mitigating circumstances that directly affected their academic performance; however, if a\\nstudent has multiple grades below a C- (including W, FX, and FW) within the semester, the acceptance of an appeal is unlikely.\\nAppeals will be reviewed by the Academic Review Committee which consists of the Deans Council, the Life Directions Center Director, and Life Directions Center\\nCoordinator of Student Success Services. The Academic Review Committee may also require the student\\'s attendance at a hearing.\\nA well written and grammatically correct appeal is required. Appeals should address:\\n• An explanation of why academic efforts were unsuccessful\\n• Reasons for wishing to remain enrolled at Colorado Christian University\\n• Changes the student will make and a plan for future success\\nA student whose appeal is accepted will be on academic probation and must follow the probationary guidelines described above. Students who withdraw in the middle of the\\nterm while onpost-suspension probationnullify their probation and will be placed back on suspension status.\\nReadmission following Academic Suspension\\nA student who decides not to appeal their academic suspension or whose appeal is denied may be considered for reinstatement at CCU when the student has successfully\\ncompleted 12 credits in a semester or summer at an accredited college or university and received a grade of C or better in all 12 credits. Attention will be given to the type of\\ncourses taken so students are advised to take courses of strong academic rigor.\\nThe student should submit an ofdcial transcript and letter requesting reinstatement to the CUS Coordinator of Student Success. The letter should include:\\n• An explanation of why previous academic efforts at CCU were unsuccessful.\\n• What changes the student made in habits, learning, lifestyle, etc. that made the semester away from CCU successful.\\n• And how the student plans to maintain academic progress.\\nThe reinstatement request deadline istwo weeks prior to the start ofthe semester.\\nThe request will be reviewed and, if accepted, the student will be notided. If the student has been gone for more than 366 days and needs to re-enroll, the student will be\\ncleared to contact Admissions for re-enrollment.\\nAny disciplinary issues pending at the time the student was academically suspended will be addressed with the student beforehe or she iscleared for re-enrollment.\\nColorado Christian University\\n58 / 1000', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The University may accept transfer credit from other\\ninstitutions and grant advanced standing to transfer students at its discretion. Non-traditional credit is earned outside of the formal academic learning environment. Credit\\nreceived for both traditional and non-traditional coursework is treated as transfer credit and does not count toward CCU residency requirements. Students are required to\\nmeet all residency requirements for graduation.\\nFor transfer work to be ofdcially evaluated for acceptance, the students must be fully admitted and ofdcial transcripts must be received by CCU’s Ofdce of the Registrar.\\nColorado Christian University\\'s Ofdce of the Registrar will review transfer credits and determine which will be accepted. All transcripts ofdcially evaluated for credit must\\nbe original ofdcial copies received directly from the institution through Parchment, NSC, or the post ofdce; photocopies, faxes, and PDFs forwarded by the student are not\\naccepted. It is the student\\'s responsibility to request that ofdcial transcripts be sent directly to Colorado Christian University.\\nPotential transfer credit is reviewed to determine its equivalency to CCU coursework. The transfer evaluation processis typically completed within 10-15 business days after\\nreceipt of the ofdcial transcript. Courses that are evaluated as transferable toward CCU degree requirements will be listed on the student\\'s progress report inSelf-Service,\\nindicating which CCU program requirements the transfer credit will satisfy. Courses that are predominantly identical in content and intent may be dedned as equivalent to\\nCCU courses and applied to the student\\'s record. Course numbers must be within one level of the CCU course and the number of credits of the transferrable course must be\\nno more than one credit less than the comparable course. Courses that are not considered equivalent to CCU coursework may be transferred as elective credit and applied\\ntoward the student\\'s elective degree requirements.\\nFor students who would fail to meet CCU’s residency requirements if all courses are transferred according to direct equivalence, particularly in the major, the Registrar’s\\nofdce will reclassify otherwise directly equivalent courses to electives to ensure residency requirements can be met. When considering additional substitutions beyond the\\ninitial evaluation provided by the Registrar’s ofdce, students are responsible to ensure they continue to meet residency requirements.\\nCCU transfers credits but not grades or grade point averages (GPA).\\nTransferring Credit from Other Universities into CCU\\nCCU will accept transfer credits that meet the requirements of the program. Transfer coursework must meet the following requirements:\\n• Credits must have been earned at an accredited institution for credit to be awarded.\\n• CCU does not accept remedial courses for transfer into CCU.\\n• For undergraduate Nursing students, all transfer credit must be a grade of C or better.\\n• For all other undergraduate programs, all transfer credit must be a grade of C- or better.\\n• Graduate-level courses must be a grade of B or better.\\n• Certain CCU degree programs, such as nursing and education, will have specidc transfer equivalency requirements.\\n• Transferred courses of P (Pass) or S (Satisfactory) must be equivalent to the grade requirements above.\\n• CUS does not accept ACE-recommended credit from programs such as Straighterline, Sophia, etc.\\nProgram SpeciUc Requirements\\nCertain courses at CCU are designated as \"protected\" courses and must be completed through CUS.See below for more information.\\nComputer science credits transferred to meet major core requirements must have been completed within dve years of acceptance for admission to CCU.\\nFor nursing students, all transfer credits must have a grade of C or better. For nursing students, CCU will only accept science courses in transfer that have been taken\\nat a regionally or nationally accredited institution.Nursing science credit transferred to meet major pre-requisite course requirements must have been completed within\\ndvey ears of acceptance foradmissionto CCU. It isrecommended that all science coursework be earned post-high school graduation for transfer to the CCU nursing\\nprogram.Students applying to the BSN program and transferring in nursing courses from another institution will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\\nDual Credit\\nDual credit is a program where students can earn college credit by taking college coursework while in high school.This coursework may be transferred to CCU to fuldll\\ngraduation requirements as applicable. A grade of C- or higher (Pre-Nursing Students: C or higher) is required for the course to transfer. Students who earn dual credit at\\nany institution other than CCU Academy must provide the ofdcial college transcript for those completed courses; high school transcripts are not sufdcient to transfer college\\ncoursework earned during high school.\\nDual credit taken through CCU Academy is considered CCU credit and can be used to satisfy residency requirements. Additionally, grades earned for dual credit taken\\nthrough CCU\\'s partner high school programs will apply toward the student\\'s CCU GPA. Dual credit coursework is generally used to fuldll general education core\\nrequirements and not major degree course requirements.CCU\\'s acceptance of dual credit for an undergraduate degree is no guarantee that graduate or medical schools will\\naccept dual credit for prerequisite requirements.\\nTechnical Credit\\nTechnical credit is dedned as vocational and occupational, but not professional in nature. Examples of technical credit are electronics, cosmetology, dental assisting, auto\\nbody repair, munitions, welding, and paraprofessional healthcare—these may come from accredited colleges or non-traditional sources. Technical credit may not be used to\\nmeet general education requirements but may be used to fuldll elective requirements. A student may transfer a maximum of 30 hours of elective credit in technical courses\\ntoward a bachelor\\'s degree.

These courses are typically identided as having a course number below 100; however, some\\ninstitutions from some states use course numbers below 100 for undergraduate courses—these will be evaluated individually to determine transferability.\\nArticulation Agreements\\nCCU may partner with other institutions to articulate a seamless process for the transfer of credits, allowing students to complete their degree at CCU. These articulation\\nagreements may be between community colleges, four-year institutions, technical institutions, unaccredited schools, etc. Credit from unaccredited institutions is only\\ntransferable if a current articulation agreement is in place, unless specidc transfer instances are approved by the Provost/VP of Academic Affairs.\\nEvaluations for VA BeneUciaries\\nThe evaluation of previous postsecondary education and training is mandatory and required for VA benedciaries.For students utilizing Veterans benedts who are approved\\nfor transfer credit as a result of this evaluation, the institution will grant appropriate credit, reduce the program length proportionately, notify the student and Veterans\\nAffairs in writing of this decision, and adjust invoicing of the VA accordingly.\\nTransfer Grades\\nThe University will accept credits, but not grades, in transfer; thus, transfer grades will not be dgured into the student\\'s CCU grade point average. Credit from unaccredited\\ninstitutions will be accepted only when the Registrar and the Vice President of Academic Affairs have approved a transfer agreement with such an institution, and in no case\\nwill more than 30 credits be transferred from these institutions.

(For a complete list of agencies, please visit theInternational Education Evaluationpage.) Evaluations will be\\ncompleted using the credential evaluation document according to standard transfer requirements stated in this document.\\nCourses Restricted from Transfer into CUS\\nCertain courses at CCU are designated as \"protected\" courses and must be completed at CCU\\'s College of Undergraduate Studies due to the unique nature and content\\nof the course provided by CUS. Transfer coursework, AP/CLEP exams, dual credit coursework, etc., will not be accepted for these courses, but may be accepted as general\\nelective credit, if applicable.\\nLimited transfer courses at CCU include:\\n• BIB/HIS-111 Old Testament\\n• BIB/HUM-114 New Testament\\n• ECO-215 Economics\\n• HIS-185 Western Civilization\\n• POL-207 Introduction to American Politics\\nTransfer credit that will be accepted prior to matriculation at CCU but will not be accepted for courses after a student matriculates to CCU\\n• Fine Arts Requirement (HUM-120, MUS-110, THR-112)\\nMajor Courses that cannot be transferred into the College of Undergraduate Studies:\\n• BUS/MGT-101 Business and Management in the 21st Century\\nTransferring Non-Traditional Credits into CAGS and CCU Academy\\nThe College of Adult and Graduate Studies and CCU Academy offer opportunities for students to reduce the time and cost of their degree by proving learning in a specidc\\ndiscipline through non-traditional credit.\\nOnline Courses Approved by the American Council on Education\\nStudents in CAGS may substitute, with approval, required courses or electives for coursework completed through online platforms like StraighterLine, Sophia, or Study.com\\nas long as they meet the American Council on Education’s recommended scores. Nursing students may not use StraighterLine, Sophia, Study.com, or similar transfer credit\\nto satisfy any science requirements in the nursing program.

The vision of the Colorado Christian University Global Studies\\nmajor is to form graduates equipped to address these challenges, and to leverage the opportunities this interconnectedness presents for advancing a\\nChristian worldview, sharing the good news of the gospel, and knowledgeably engaging the nations of the world, whether at home or abroad.\\nTo implement this vision, the program adopts an interdisciplinary approach, synthesizing methods and insights from such fields as cultural anthropology,\\ngeopolitics and diplomacy, history, missiology, business, linguistics, geography, economics, and more, into a cohesive understanding of the world today.\\nWhereas the secular Global Studies student is taught to view the world in terms of neo-Marxist ideology or Critical Theory, the CCU student adds to his or\\nher intercultural competence a firm grounding in a Christian, pro-Western, and conservative worldview. \\nUpon graduation, students are prepared to pursue careers at home or abroad in such areas as diplomacy, international business, international law, public\\nrelations, foreign service, traditional mission, journalism, or service with non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations. They are prepared to\\nleverage their broad base of knowledge, interdisciplinary skills, critical thinking, and writing skills to pursue graduate study in law, economics, business,\\nanthropology, history, and more. Most importantly, CCU Global Studies graduates are equipped to effectively and eloquently engage the world with grace\\nand truth, contributing positively and professionally in their chosen fields.\\nAll Global Studies majors are required to complete an international experience with CCU, consisting of one of the following, subject to approval by the\\nDean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences:\\na CCU2theWorld International Mission Trip,\\nan international academic travel course,\\na \\nGLS325 International Practicum\\n international internship, international research experience, or other pre-professional international experience\\n(a domestic internship would not normally count),\\nTHE385 Field Experience Intercul Min\\n field experience in Intercultural Ministry,\\na study abroad semester,\\nother international experiences, if pre-approved by program director.\\nGraduates of the Global Studies Major will be able to:\\n1.     Articulate a Christian, conservative, pro-Western worldview, defending it against alternative ideologies, including neo-Marxism and Critical Theory.\\n2.     Utilize an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the complexities of globalization and its social, economic, political, and cultural dimensions, connecting\\nthese global issues to local and regional contexts.\\n3.     Demonstrate intercultural communicative competence, cultural intelligence, and second language skills to communicate effectively with people from\\ndiverse cultures and worldviews, facilitating evangelism and understanding in both local and global contexts.\\n4.     Apply critical thinking, analytical, and writing skills to explain how local circumstances influence global events and vice versa, enabling informed\\ndiscussions about contemporary issues.\\n5.     Design a thoughtful post-graduation vocational plan that reflects a commitment to engaging with global issues, guided by a Christian perspective and a\\nvision for impacting the world with grace and truth.\\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies requires completion of the following 120 credits:\\nGeneral Education Core (48 credit hours)\\nGlobal Studies Major Core (33 credit hours)\\nElectives (39 credit hours)\\nProgram Type\\nBachelor's Degree\\nProgram Requirements\\nSimple Requisites\\nProgram Requirements\\nGeneral Education Requirements (48 credit hours)\\nType\\nCompletion \\nRequirement\\nFine Arts (3 credit hours)\\nComplete at least 1 of the following \\ncourses:\\nHUM120 - Introduction to the Arts\\nMUS110 - Musical Perspectives\\nTHR112 - Theatre Appreciation\\nLiterature (3 credit hours)\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This program is comprised of general education, behavioral, and biological science pre-requisite\\ncoursework totaling 60 credit hours. The nursing major includes theory (in-seat ), laboratory (skills/simulation), and clinical components. Nursing courses\\nare delivered in a blended format for greater flexibility. The nursing major core courses in CUS are offered over four semesters in a traditional academic\\nformat with summers off.\\nThe general education and biological science curriculum, grounded in biblical truth, is intended to provide a broad-based knowledge of the arts and\\nsciences required for students to understand the complex world of healthcare and to be prepared for success in the nursing major courses.  As is consistent\\nwith the University's mission, there is an emphasis on spiritual formation leading to the integration of learning, faith, and practice as students provide\\ncompassionate care.\\nThis practice discipline degree emphasizes clinical judgment, professionalism, moral leadership, evidence-based nursing practice, technology\\nmanagement, and interprofessional communication within healthcare delivery.  Competency, character, and calling are fostered in an effort to prepare\\nnurses to practice nursing as ministry. CCU challenges students to become exceptionally competent knowledgeable nurse leaders who think critically to\\nimpact their world and transform healthcare through the uniqueness of Christ-inspired practice. Nursing at CCU is a scientific discipline and a sacred\\ncalling. \\nThe Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree requires completion of the following 120 credit hours:\\nGeneral Education/Behavioral Science: (39 credit hours)\\nBiological Sciences: (21 credit hours)\\nNursing Major Core: BSN (60 credit hours)\\nProfessional Licensure Disclosure\\nColorado Christian University offers several academic programs which lead to professional licensure in the state of Colorado and, in some programs,\\nprepare students for a national exam.

The goals of the Outdoor\\nLeadership Minor are:\\nSpiritual transformation\\n - moving people from their actual to potential in Christ; and able to use outdoor experiences to encourage people to say\\n\"yes\" to God.\\nLeadership development\\n - the Scriptures indicate God\\'s strategy for developing leaders almost always involved transformative outdoor\\nexperiences. Development is accelerated outdoors due to the experiential challenges faced, consequences of decision making, and short feedback\\nloops.\\nCharacter formation\\n - developing perseverance and resiliency, embracing challenges, and growing in Christ-likeness for the sake of others.\\nOutdoor skills acquisition\\n - sound skills are prerequisites for risk management in leading self or others in any outdoor context, and a pioneering\\nwitness for Christ in the secular outdoor workplace is competency.\\nStudents are required to experience a 7-day backpack trip where they are introduced to backcountry skills and use of God\\'s creation for spiritual\\ntransformation. They must also learn the biblical and theological basis for outdoor leadership; outdoor pedagogy, theory, and contexts; and management\\nand administration of outdoor programs. Elective courses include many outdoor skills and certifications. Courses go to nearby locations such as Rocky\\nMountain National Park and Colorado \"14ers,\" as well as Grand Canyon National Park.\\nFaculty are practicing professionals with many decades of cumulative field experience, advanced degrees, and advanced certifications.

To implement this vision, the Politics program educates Christian students in a broad understanding\\nof the art and science of politics, based on a biblical foundation and worldview. It trains them to apply biblical knowledge, Christian virtues, and ethical\\nprinciples to politics and also helps them to develop entry-level professional skills necessary for success in politics and related fields.\\nThe study of Politics at Colorado Christian University deliberately combines philosophic breadth and theological insight with practical skills and\\nengagement with the contemporary world. Students explore human nature and ethics alongside of political and economic power and history. They are led\\nto grapple with the meaning and significance of the American Founding, the relation of virtue and liberty, the rule of law and human happiness, America's\\nrole in the world, and the current political landscape.  Within the Politics major itself, students may choose an emphasis in Public Policy or American\\nPolitics, if so desired.\\nThe Politics major at Colorado Christian University is designed to prepare students for a number of careers, including those of public service, criminal\\njustice, journalism, public policy research, and political consulting. Students will also be prepared for graduate school or law school. The major doubles\\neasily with other majors such as Business, Communications, Global Studies, History, or Psychology. \\nGraduates of the Politics Major will be able to: \\n1. Identify key figures and articulate important ideas of political philosophy, and deploy them to analyze American politics, institutions, policies, and\\ninternational relations.\\n2. Articulate Constitutional principles and apply them to the institutions and challenges in current American politics, both at home and abroad.\\n3. Articulate a philosophy of statesmanship, and integrate politics with a biblical worldview. \\n4. Demonstrate advanced knowledge of comparative political systems, international relations, and foreign policy.\\n5. Employ critical thinking and analysis, and communicate and defend ideas persuasively and cogently, on the basis of evidence and sound research.\\n6. (American Politics Emphasis).  Demonstrate an advanced knowledge of American institutions, the constitutional order, and American political culture;\\nand articulate and apply the principles of individual freedom, limited government, and the rights and duties of citizenship.\\n7. (Public Policy Emphasis). Demonstrate advanced understanding of the American public policy process, and perform effective public policy analysis and\\nwriting.\\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Politics requires completion of the following 120 credits:\\nGeneral Education Core (48 credit hours)\\nPolitics Major Core (39 credit hours)\\nElectives (33 credit hours)\\nProgram Type\\nBachelor's Degree\\nProgram Requirements\\nSimple Requisites\\nProgram Requirements\\nGeneral Education Requirements (48 credit hours)\\nType\\nCompletion \\nRequirement\\nFine Arts (3 credit hours)\\nComplete at least 1 of the following \\ncourses:\\nHUM120 - Introduction to the Arts\\nMUS110 - Musical Perspectives\\nTHR112 - Theatre Appreciation\\nLiterature (3 credit hours)\\nComplete at least 1 of the following \\ncourses:\\nENG201 - Introduction to Literature\\nENG202 - American Literature I\\nENG203 - American Literature II\\nENG204 - British Literature I\\nENG205 - British Literature II\\nPhilosophy (3 credit hours)\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Classroom instruction and experiences focus not only on the content of psychology (theoretical and experimental psychology),\\nbut also on the character development of our students challenging them to engage in personal spiritual formation which quite naturally impacts how they\\nunderstand psychology.  This mixture of classes allows our students to understand, test, and apply current psychological theories within their personal lives\\nand real situations.  The emphasis in the psychology major is to equip our students to think critically about current psychological theories, principles, and\\nresearch through the lens of foundational Christian beliefs.\\nThe Psychology major prepares students for careers in psychology and related fields. At the bachelor\\'s level, several job options exist for graduates in\\npsychology, such as paraprofessionals in clinics, hospitals and schools, case workers in social service, and staff in church and parachurch ministries. Those\\nintending to practice psychology professionally, however, will need graduate-level training toward the master\\'s degree or the doctorate. The\\nundergraduate program develops a broad-based education that creates a deeper understanding of human functioning and equips students to succeed in\\ngraduate school. Elective courses allow students to \"round out\" their studies to prepare not only for graduate training but to enter life with key relational,\\nspiritual, and emotional competencies.\\nGraduates of the Psychology major will be able to:\\n1. Analyze and evaluate Biblical evidence for the five themes of a Biblical and psychological view of human nature.\\n2. Define and evaluate the model of authentic sexual relationships and the model for Christian marriage.\\n3. Describe and differentiate various personality theories, psychological disorders, and clinical counseling methods.\\n4. Create and evaluate research that includes cognitive and physiological processes. \\n5. Describe and explain the various sub-disciplines within psychology.\\nIn collaboration with the College of Adult and Graduate Studies (CAGS), students majoring in Psychology can opt for one of three emphases:\\nBA Psychology with an Emphasis in Biblical Studies\\nBA Psychology with an Emphasis in Clinical Counseling\\nBA Psychology with an Emphasis in Criminal Justice\\nStudents who choose one of the emphases above earn their Psychology major in their first three years in CCU\\'s Dual Degree programs, and have 10-12\\ngraduate-level credit hours that can be applied toward a master\\'s degree in CAGS. Additional information on the Psychology Dual Degree program is\\nbelow.\\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (CUS) requires completion of the following 120 credits:\\nGeneral Education Core (48 credit hours)\\nPsychology Major Required Core (33 credit hours)\\nPsychology Major Electives Core (6 credit hours)\\nGeneral Electives (33 credit hours)\\nProgram Type\\nBachelor\\'s Degree\\nProgram Requirements\\nSimple Requisites\\nProgram Requirements\\nGeneral Education Requirements (48 credit hours)\\nType\\nCompletion \\nRequirement\\nFine Arts (3 credit hours)\\nComplete at least 1 of the following \\ncourses:\\nHUM120 - Introduction to the Arts\\nMUS110 - Musical Perspectives\\nTHR112 - Theatre Appreciation\\nLiterature (3 credit hours)\\nComplete at least 1 of the following \\ncourses:', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

We intend for students to \\nleave CCU not only prepared intellectually to follow a career where students can \\nserve others and live out their faith  but also to change the world around them. \\nThis is the spirit of the guidelines defined in this handbook. The guidelines express \\na commitment to educating men and women while integrating the Christian faith \\nwith the learning processes that students will be involved in for the rest of their \\nlives. These guidelines also express the University’s commitment to providing an \\natmosphere for study, personal exploration, and involvement in interpersona l \\nrelationships, spiritual life, and growth.  These guidelines are designed to ensure \\nthat students can develop within an atmosphere most conducive to achieving \\ngoals in each of these areas  while enjoying living and learning within the spirit of \\nthe Christian community. \\n \\nOur Mission \\nChrist-centered higher education transforms students to impact the world with \\ngrace and truth.

In this commitment, the \\nUniversity embraces the following declarations of the National Association of \\nEvangelicals: \\n• We Believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word \\nof God. \\n• We Believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, \\nSon and Holy Spirit. \\n• We Believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless \\nlife, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, \\nin His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and \\nin His personal return in power and glory. \\n• We Believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful people, regeneration by the \\nHoly Spirit is absolutely essential. \\n• We Believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the \\nChristian is enabled to live a godly life. \\n• We Believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are \\nsaved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection \\nof damnation. \\n• We Believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.  \\n• These declarations do not comprise all that individual Christians may consider \\nimportant elements of faith; rather, they establish the essential framework \\nwithin which members of the University both unite in shared beliefs and \\nexplore differences. \\n \\nStatement of Convictions \\nCCU is a Christian institution of higher education. Our University rests on \\na belief system where truth matters and where there is a unifying center \\n(Christ) that holds all things and disciplines together. This has been our \\nconviction since our founding in 1914, and it continues to be our \\nconviction today. But the truth is to be held and lived out in love. Hence \\nour motto, “grace and truth.”  (John 1:14-16; Ephesians 4:15) \\n \\nHoly Scripture \\nWe have always believed in the truthfulness of the Bible. We understand \\nthe use of the word “infallibility” in our Statement of Faith to mean \\ninerrancy (as articulated in The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy), \\nthat the 66 books of the Bible, in their original manuscripts, are without \\nerror in all that they affirm. Scripture is our supreme authority under \\nChrist.

The term \\n“evangelical” comes from the Greek word euangelion, meaning “the good \\nnews” or the “gospel.” Thus, the evangelical faith focuses on the “good \\nnews” of salvation brought to sinners through Jesus Christ. We have a \\nbiblical mandate to share this good news everywhere. We also \\nunderstand the language of being “saved” in our Statement of Faith to \\nmean that we are saved (i.e., justified) by grace alone, through faith \\nalone, in Christ alone, and that true faith will show itself in good works. \\n(Romans 3:21-28; Romans 5:1; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 2:8-10) \\n \\nRace and Ethnicity \\nBelieving in a biblical view of human nature, we affirm that all people are \\nmade in the image of God and are consequently worthy of respect. \\nScripture also states that Christ has “ransomed people for God from every \\ntribe and language and people and nation, and … made them a kingdom \\nand priests to our God.” Therefore, we look at the value of all persons \\nthrough the lens of biblical truth as image bearers who can have a new \\nidentity in Christ. (Genesis 1:26,27; Ephesians 1-2; Revelation 5:9,10) \\n \\nSex and Gender \\nIn affirming “traditional family values” in our Strategic Priorities, we mean \\nwhat Bible-believing Christians have always meant and what we have \\nbelieved as an institution since our founding in 1914: that God created \\nhuman beings in His image as male and female, that He ordained that \\nmarriage is to be between a man (male) and a woman (female) for life \\nand that sexual intimacy is exclusively for marriage.

For the University to achieve this goal within an atmosphere where \\nthe rights of its members are respected, it is necessary to establish policies and \\nprocedures that govern student conduct. These regulations have been developed \\nto reflect the nature of a student community focused on educational and spiritual \\ngrowth and the unique situations that arise within such a community of learners. \\nAs such, every member of the University community is provided equal rights and \\nbenefits in accordance with the expectation t hat each student demonstrates \\nmaturity, intelligence, and concern for the rights of others. \\n \\nWhen a person demonstrates a lack of cooperation, respect, or consideration for \\nhimself or herself, the standards of the University, or the University community, \\nCCU, acting through its officials and judiciary bodies, will take disciplinary action. \\nBehavior that disrupts the community atmosphere at CCU, whether attempted or \\ncommitted, cannot be tolerated, and will be addressed. Thus, it is the goal of the \\nstudent discipline process, as outlined in Proverbs 13:24, to show the love of Jesus \\nChrist for the Uni versity’s students through prompt correction of behavior that \\ndisturbs the University educational community, based on a system of grace and \\nguidance. \\n \\nCCU students in the College of Undergraduate Studies are asked to assume \\npositions of responsibility in the university judicial system  as members of the \\nUniversity Student Standards and Accountability Board (which will be described \\nlater in this section) in order that they might contribute their skills and insights to \\nthe resolution of disciplinary cases. Final authority for disciplinary matters, \\nhowever, is vested in the University administration, the President of the University \\nand his designees, and the University Board of Trustees. Under this authority, the \\nVice President of Student Life and Traditional Enrollment may assign adjudication \\nof cases to the Student Standards and Accountability Board or administrative \\nhearing officers at his discretion. \\nIt is the intention of this code of conduct to clarify the standards of behavior \\nessential to the University’s educational mission and its community life. \\nConsequently, the Standards of Conduct are applicable to all College of \\nUndergraduate (CUS) students and their guests when visiting campus. \\n \\nPurpose \\nOne of the distinctions of Christian Higher Education is the pursuit of a community \\nthat seeks holistic student growth (spiritual, intellectual, personal, emotional, and \\nvocational) in an atmosphere that follows the example of Jesus Christ and Biblical \\nteachings.

As such, students are expected to live in \\naccordance with the teachings of Scripture. Scripture teaches the Lordship of Jesus \\nChrist over all of life and thought and stressed the importance of caring  for one’s \\nwhole being as a temple of the Holy Spirit. Believers are urged to be careful \\nstewards of the mind, time, abilities, funds, and opportunities that have been \\ngiven by God, and are instructed to love God with all of their being and to love \\ntheir n eighbors as themselves. In this way, CCU students must realize the \\nimportant responsibility they have to personal righteousness, the practice of \\njustice, the value of evangelistic outreach through word and life, and the exercise \\nof freedom in Christ. The U niversity realizes that most of what Scripture teaches \\nin regard to attitude and behavior are difficult to define in terms of Standards of \\nConduct yet lie at the heart of relationships with God and with others. Thus, we \\nencourage all members of the University community to address such attitudes and \\nbehaviors as they become discernible for positive change to occur. \\n \\nIn addition, all laws of the nation, state, and local community are to be obeyed. Of \\ncourse, some issues regarding community living are not specifically addressed in \\nScripture or civil laws, and in such cases, CCU’s Standards of Conduct direct \\nstudents to act with respect for others, consider others’ sensitivities  and exercise \\npersonal restraint to provide an optimal community living and learning \\nenvironment. \\n \\nCCU’s Standards of Conduct seek to integrate Biblical teachings, civil laws, and \\ncommunity standards based on the consideration and respect for others to help \\ncreate and maintain a community environment in which all CCU students, whether \\non- or off-campus, strive to deepen their spiritual commitment and understanding \\nof the Bible;  develop their moral character;  expand their intellectual abilities;  \\nparticipate constructively in community life; and observe and adhere to the rules \\nand regulations of the University. \\n \\nCCU encourages its students to take particular care to exercise discretion in their \\nchoice of entertainment, relationships, and associations. Students should also be \\naware of the growing problem of drugs, sexual behavior, and alcohol abuse today, \\nas well as the offensiveness and danger of the use of tobacco. The University \\nrecognizes that these practices reduce the effectiveness of corporate testimony \\nand could harm others. To this end, all such activity is banned from the campus \\nand off-campus CCU students are subject to disciplinary review when information \\nregarding alcohol, sexual activity, or drug use comes to the University’s attention.

In addition, learning to live within a common set of \\nbehavior standards seeks to increase students’ abilities to live with others in a \\ngroup situation and to function well in the campus community within the \\nUniversity’s expectations. Consequently, disciplinary proceedings will be initiated \\nwhen it becomes apparent that informal procedures are unlikely to produce \\ndesired changes in behavior. Accordingly, each student will be treated as an \\nindividual within formal disciplinary procedures. \\n \\nIt is assumed that individuals who join the University community will strive to \\ndeepen their spiritual commitment and understanding of the Bible; develop their \\nmoral character; expand their intellectual abilities; participate constructively in \\ncommunity li fe; and observe and adhere to the rules and regulations of the \\nUniversity as long as they are CCU students. This refers to all CCU students, \\nincluding those living on and off campus. \\nThe following are the purposes for disciplinary proceedings at CCU:  \\n● To redirect behavior \\n● To protect the rights of others in the community \\n● To encourage and to teach responsibility for one’s own actions  \\n● To encourage an educationally -focused student living and learning \\ncommunity \\n● To discuss and explore with students how one’s behavior is an outgrowth of \\nour relationship with Christ. \\n \\nSince one of the main foundations of the discipline process involves emphasizing \\na student’s responsibility for his or her behavior, student records will remain on -\\nfile for the entire length of his or her stay at the University. \\n \\nNon-Disciplinary Policy  \\nAlthough the University seeks to correct students when they exhibit behavior \\ncontrary to its mission, CCU also wants to assist and guide students when they are \\nstruggling with a personal issue, relationship problem, or an issue normally \\nhandled through the  discipline process.

Course withdrawal from a specific CCU class or total academic withdrawal \\nfrom the University (arrangements must be made within 5 business days). \\n10. Necessary criminal or civil action with local, state or federal authorities . \\n11. Alternative requirements or conditions should typically be imposed in \\naddition to normal disciplinary sanctions (i.e. warnings, probation, and \\nsuspensions), and not instead of them. If these alternative requirements \\nare violated by the student or if he/she  fails to meet conditions set for \\nhim/her in the disciplinary or judicial process, a more serious sanction up \\nto and including suspension or dismissal, may be imposed at the \\ndiscretion of the Vice President of Student Life and Traditional Enrollment \\nor his designees, without further hearing or review. If the alternate \\nrequirements or conditions are not met within the allotted time indicated \\nby the discipline letter, a disciplinary stop will be placed on the student’s \\naccount which will prevent him or he r from registering for classes or \\nobtaining a diploma or a transcript. This stop will be removed when the \\nconditions are met. If requirements are assigned the last week of the \\nsemester and the student Life official allows for them to be completed in \\nthe following semester, a hold will be placed on the student’s account \\nimmediately and will be removed once requirements have been \\ncompleted. \\n \\nSummary Sanctions \\nSummary Sanctions may include suspension or dismissal of a student and \\nexclusion from University property may be imposed without the hearing process \\noutlined in this section.

In using the following guidelines, the Student Standards and \\nAccountability Board (SSAB) or Hearing Officer should give primary consideration \\nto the seriousness of th e offense and the prior disciplinary record of the student \\nwhen deciding upon an appropriate s anction. The prior disciplinary record of the \\nstudent is not used in determining accountability of the incident in question, but \\nwill be used in determining appropriate sanctions outlined in the Disciplinary \\nSanctions section of this code. Other considerat ions may include the attitude of \\nthe student during the disciplinary process, including his or her cooperation, or \\nlack of cooperation during the incident being reviewed, and recommendations \\nfrom faculty or staff at the University. However, the Board or of ficer should \\ntypically employ the following guidelines in determining an appropriate sanction, \\nrequirement, or condition, unless there are exceptional circumstances that \\nwarrant the imposition of an alternative outcome to the hearing. Note that \\nsanctions can be varied from this standard as the hearing officer involved takes all \\nthings about the case into consideration. \\n \\nFeatures of the Process \\nThe disciplinary process is designed to be interactive between minor, \\nprobationary/ suspension, and major violations. Steps add together to accumulate \\na final sanction. For example, a student violating a probationary/ suspension \\nprohibited conduct can receive three steps in the system. If a student is already on \\na step 2 violation for another minor violation, the student would automatically be \\nplaced on a step 5 sanction. Because of this feature, it is important that the student \\nrealize which step he/she sh e is on, and what possibilities remain if he/she \\ncontinues unacceptable behavior. Hence, the foundation of the step system is that \\na student always knows what behavior receives what sanctions, where he/she falls \\nwithin that system, and an easy view of what is to come should he or she continue \\ntheir inappropriate behavior pattern. The University’s goal is to have the student \\nchoose to re -direct his/her behavior, in order to meet University expectations in \\nthis area. In some cases, a student could be dismisse d for his/her first known \\nviolation of the Code of Conduct if separate incidents add together to be placed \\non a step 6. It is not the intent of the disciplinary process to add up as many \\nincidents as possible, but if separate violations occurred in the pas t and they \\nbecome known, it is possible that a student will be held accountable for all of \\nthem. \\n \\n  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The University recognizes that a student may have an initial reaction of \\ndishonesty u pon being confronted with his or her accountability in a given \\nsituation, but it is the University’s expectation that students learn to submit to \\nauthority and take responsibility for their actions. \\n \\nRepeated Violations \\nRepeated or aggravated violations of any section of the Standards of Conduct will \\nlikely result in additional sanctions, particularly if the infractions occurred during a \\nDisciplinary Probation period. \\n \\nTerm of Sanction \\nThe term of any sanction imposed as a result of disciplinary infractions will ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Possible violations will be \\nreferred to the Vice President  of Student Life and Traditional Enrollment , or his \\ndesignee, for processing under the provisions of the Standards of Conduct. \\nSanctions for a student group may include revocation of the group’s rig ht to exist \\nat the University, as well as other appropriate sanctions. Student groups will be \\naccorded the same hearing and appeal procedures provided for students herein.  \\n \\nNote on Student Absence and School Breaks \\nStudents who are away from the University for a period of time for academic \\nsuspensions, disciplinary dismissals, leave of absence, study abroad, etc. and are \\nfound in violation of University Policies, during their absence may not be allowed \\nto return as a CCU student. \\n \\nIf the University learns a student has violated a University policy during extended \\nbreaks in the year (Fall Break, Winter Break, Spring Break and Summer Break), the \\nUniversity may choose to pursue discipline appropriate to the violation.  \\n \\nFormal Hearings \\nIn the event an accused student is granted a review of his/her case , the case will \\nbe adjudicated by an Administrative Hearing Officer or an Administrative Conduct \\nCommittee. In most cases, the committee will adjudicate, however depending on \\nthe time of year, the readiness of the committee, or the nature of the case, an \\nAdministrative Hearing by a Hearing may be more appropriate.

Therefore, CCU has created \\nunique policies that allow students to change their behavior without threat of \\ndisciplinary measures. Below is a more detailed description of each policy and the \\nrequirements for each. Students should note th e staff and faculty are available to \\nhelp students assess specific situations. They are available to assist students in \\nidentifying better ways to confront students in a violation or to talk through \\nspecific situations to help determine the best course of action. \\n \\nNon-Discipline Agreement \\nAs Paul outlined in his writing to the Galatians (4:8-14), the staff and faculty at CCU \\nfeel challenged and take great pride in assisting students who are struggling with \\nhard, but real Life issues. In the instance of a student coming forward to an RA, RD, \\nor a faculty or staff member on their own initiative or through the Mutual \\nAccountability Commitment, there will be no disciplinary implications. If a student \\ncommunicates to a RA, that RA must pass along the information to their RD to be \\nconsidered for a  non-discipline agreement. The student will, however, need to \\nadhere to the guidance and resources given to help them, and it will be the \\nUniversity’s expectation that the student completes a plan to help overcome the \\narea in which they are struggling. \\n \\nIt is our hope that after a student has taken the first step to come forward, they \\nwill find that the resources, support, and help that are available were worth the \\nrisk. The problem will remain confidential, and the plan of action to help the \\nstudent deal with the problem will be arrived at mutually with staff, the student, \\nand any other resource that the student may wish to call upon. \\n \\nThis policy does not cover students who, because of an impending or ongoing \\nCCU disciplinary investigation *, come forward before the investigation finds \\nthem accountable for inappropriate behavior . This policy also does not cover \\nstudents who have been involved in an alleged policy violation where the police \\nwere involved. As soon as the student involved shows any sign of non-cooperation \\nwith the process, including missing counseling appointments, or continues in the \\nundesired behavior, parents or guardians will be brought into the situation and \\nthe student will enter into the formal disciplinary process. \\n \\nIf a student seeks a non -discipline agreement regarding an incident that involves \\nseveral students violating University policies, it is expected that the student will \\nshare information regarding these students. The student may then be asked to \\nprovide testimony in subsequent hearings.

One goal is to create a safe place for students to be vulnerable and \\nreal regarding struggles in their lives. It is an aspirational goal for students to \\nengage with one an other in ways that promote vulnerability and reduce shame, \\nwhile also exhorting one another toward behavior that is consistent with God’s \\nWord and the Lifestyle Covenant Agreement. \\nChristian community is defined in the Bible through many “one another verses.”  \\n● “Love one another.” John 13:34, 13:35, 15:12, 15:17; Romans 13:8; I \\nThessalonians 4:9; I Peter 3:8, 4:8; I John 3:11, 3:23, 4:11, 4:12; II John 5  \\n● “Be at peace with one another.” Mark 9:50 \\n● “Live in harmony with one another.” Romans 12:16 \\n● “Serve one another in love.” Galatians 5:13 \\n● “Bear one another’s burdens.” Galatians 6:2 \\n● “Encourage one another.” I Thessalonians 4:18, 5:11; Hebrews 3:13, \\n10:25 \\n● “Spur one another on to love and good deeds.” Hebrews 10:24  \\n● “Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.” James 5:16 \\n● “Be kind and compassionate to one another.” Ephesians 4:32  \\n● “Forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.” \\nColossians 3:13 \\nCCU wants the campus to abide by these verses and use them as a guide for how \\nto engage in relationships. \\n \\nBecause the University is deeply committed to the high standard of a Christian \\ncommunity, we come together under certain standards to live, learn, and foster a \\ndeeper relationship with God. Although the campus community has agreed to live \\nby the Lifestyle Covenant Agreement, there may be instances where community \\nmembers do not abide by the principles laid out in the agreement. CCU feels it is \\nan obligation and privilege of our community members to confront others when \\nthey stray from God’s Word and t he Bib lically-based values, morals, and \\ncommitments that are set forth by the University through the Lifestyle Covenant \\nAgreement and Student Handbook. \\n \\nWhile acknowledging that CCU is a university and not a church, the process for \\nconfrontation and restoration is laid out in Matthew 18:15-16, “If your brother sins \\nagainst you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone.

This may \\ninclude confronting sin that affects the heart such as anger, lust, jealousy, etc., or \\na sin that manifests itself in outward behavior, such as underage consumption of \\nalcohol, alcohol abuse, using illicit substances, engaging in sexual activity outside \\nof marriage, or using pornography. \\n \\nWhen a student’s Lifestyle is inconsistent with the Lifestyle Covenant or Student \\nHandbook, CCU expects that students will confront and encourage one another. \\nTo help students understand the expectations in different circumstances, the \\nfollowing provides clarification to the expectation. \\n \\n“I saw” or Knowing Presences \\nIf a student is present while a University Standard is being violated and witnessed \\nthe violation, the University expects the student to confront those violating the \\nUniversity Standard.  If those confronted stop violating that standard that is the \\nend of the situation. \\n \\nIf those confronted do not stop violating the standard, it is the University’s \\nexpectation that the confronting student, sharing the same beliefs about \\ncommunity and having concern for the student’s health and safety, will approach \\nUniversity officials about the student in question . This is not seen as \"tattling\" or \\nsnitching, as in a negative way to get them in trouble; but rather a form of \"telling\" \\nor reporting in order to help and promote their overall well -being. This “telling” \\nreflects a mutual commitment to genuine Christian concern and a commitment to \\nUniversity standards. If the confronting student does not report the violation, then \\nhe/she can bring the University discipline process upon themselves, if the violation \\nis discovered by the University.  The confronted student(s) will also face \\nappropriate discipline process. \\n \\nIf the incident is discovered by the University and learns that nobody confronted \\nthe situation, any student involved in the incident may be entered into the \\nUniversity discipline process. \\n \\n“I was told” \\nIf student A is told by student B of their struggle with violating a University ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In the instance of confrontation, the University encourages an open \\nand honest discourse, in love, that will lead to a plan of action for how student B \\nwill find key resources to help him or her through his or her struggle to gain victory \\nover the behavior. This includes counseling, accountability groups, staff/faculty \\nmentoring, the non-discipline process or personal accountability with student A. If \\nit becomes evident to student A that student B is not making a sincere effort to \\nchange the behavior, the University expects that student A would report the \\nbehavior to a staff member. It is th e University’s goal to help students access the \\nresources necessary to help them address these issues. \\n \\n“I heard” \\nWhen students hear about violations of the University Standards through 3rd \\nparty situations or social media, the University hopes that the student would \\naddress the situation as it seems appropriate. For example, if a student hears \\ninformation about somebody who is close to them, the University hopes that the \\nstudent will approach the other student in the manner stated above in the “I was \\ntold” section. Even though this information may not have been shared directly \\nwith the student, the University hopes th at because of the relationship that the \\nstudent would want to help their friend in a manner that would encourage them \\naway from the inappropriate behavior. If a student hears information about \\nsomebody they don’t know, we hope that the student will not par ticipate in \\nspreading information about that person and that the student will encourage \\nanybody who knows the student in question to responding in a manner as stated \\nin the “I was told” section. The University recognizes that students may hear \\ninformation that they are not sure is true or not true so students are encouraged \\nto approach others with respect and in a non-accusatory manner. Students should \\nkeep in mind that confronting others should be out of concern and care of the \\nother student. \\n \\nResources \\nStudents are encouraged to speak to their Resident Assistant (RA), Resident \\nDirector (RD), D -Group Leader, LDC Advisors or other trusted staff or faculty \\nmember if they are unsure of how to approach another student about their \\nbehavior.

It is \\nthe University’s solid belief that illegal drugs of any kind are wholly inappropriate \\nin the lives of its students. The University will cooperate fully with local and federal \\nauthorities when dealing in situations involving them. The University hopes that \\nany student who finds himself or herself faced in a situation where drugs are being \\nused will immediately leave the situation or call the appropriate authorities.  \\n \\nAlthough possession and use of marijuana is no longer a crime in the State of \\nColorado, the possession and use of marijuana remains illegal under federal law. \\nConsistent with federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act and the Drug-\\nFree Schools and Communities Act, the use and possession of marijuana (smoked \\nor edible) continues to be prohibited for all CCU students on or off campus. In \\naddition, all CCU students are prohibited from using synthetic marijuana (i.e., K2 \\nor Spice or any other synthetic product that, when consumed,  mimics the effects \\nof cannabis).

Because of the University’s commitment \\nto fostering Christ -centered Lifestyles, the University is sensitive to the role that \\ngambling may play in students’ lives. \\n \\nThe University’s sensitivity to gambling reflects conflicting interests. On the one \\nhand, the singular danger associated with gambling is that it can become an \\naddictive behavior that is contrary to the Christ -centered Lifestyle that Scripture \\nand the University seek  to foster and is highly destructive to oneself and others.  \\nImplicit in a gambling Lifestyle is the danger that the Christian’s stewardship of \\nresources God has placed in one’s care may be abused. This Lifestyle may also \\nproduce a negative impa ct on the CCU community and may cause damage to or \\nalter relationships when one student gains while another student loses. On the \\nother hand, the University recognizes that card games can be valuable  as a \\ncommunity-building and recreational activity and values those ways of enhancing \\ncommunity among the individuals of the CCU student body. \\n \\nAs a result, within this spirit of community-building and recreation, the University \\npermits its students, when on campus, to engage in card games so long as they are \\noccasional and have at their center a community -building aspect and are not for \\nmonetary or other valuable gain. Games that become competitive, aggressive, or \\nfinancially burdensome to any participants are prohibited. Raffles, bingo, and \\npools are also prohibited, considered public gambling by the state, and a state \\npermit is required by law.

In this process, The University will \\nuphold a view that we are “fearfully and wonderfully made” in the uniqueness and \\nimage of God and, therefore, strategically and purposefully made as the biological \\nsex we were born as. Because of this belief, the University will not allow a student \\nof a particular sex to dress and act differently than the biological one that God \\ncreated them to be. Students will be assigned housing according to their biological \\nsex (given to them by God at birth). When a student decides to identify as a gender \\nother than their biological sex, by requesting a change of pronouns or surgical \\nresponse to their sense that they are in the “wrong” body, it is in theirs, and the \\nUniversity’s, best interest for them to leave the University community. It is also in \\nthe best interest of the University and the student for them to separate \\nthemselves from the CCU community if she or he pursue a medical course of action \\nto physically change their biological sex to that of another sex. \\n \\nColorado Christian University also does not permit students to publicly identify as \\nfurriers or engage in furry-related activities on campus or at university-sponsored \\nevents.

Christians know that God’s way is offensive to the world, but sometimes we \\nforget that God’s way can also be offensive to other Christians as well. In response \\nto these attempts, Christian scholars at CCU and elsewhere have concluded that \\nthese attempts to discount the biblical injunctions do not withstand scrutiny and \\nthat the unambiguous rejection in scripture of same-sex sexual activity remains in \\nforce for believers today. It is with these scholars that we as an institution join. \\n \\nGod created human beings to show forth God’s image as male and female in \\nrelationship (Gen 1:26 -28), and the biblical ideal is the expression of sexuality \\nwithin a heterosexual, Lifelong, monogamous union (Mk 10:4 - 12). However, \\nGod’s ideal for human sexuality, as with every aspect of humanity, has been \\ninterrupted by humanity’s rebellion and God’s judgment. As a result, some human \\nbeings experience confusion regarding their gender id entity and/or sexual \\norientation. When students at CCU find themselves with questions regarding their \\ngender identity, or sexual orientation, they are encouraged to come forward and \\ntake advantage of the University’s Counseling Center services and pastoral \\nresources to help guide and direct them through their struggle. All disclosures of \\nsame-sex attraction or behavior which occur within our Counseling Center therapy \\nsessions and/or Campus Pastor are held confidential by law.  \\n \\nAt times (depending on the situation)  it may be necessary to remove a student \\nfrom specific involvement such as athletic team participation, leadership positions, \\nor other University activities either temporarily or permanently. The University will \\nallow students to continue their enrollment at the University as long as they can \\nremain celibate, and as they undergo counseling and mentoring. All students who \\nare not married are required to remain celibate, whether they are same -sex \\nattracted or opposite -sex attracted. It is the University’s desire to walk with the \\nstudent through their struggle with their sexual orientation. If a student does \\nengage in a same -sex relationship, violates the policy on same -sex behavior, or \\nexhibits same-sex intimate relationshi p behavior anytime during the mentoring, \\nhe or she will be disciplined within the terms of the sexual conduct/activity policy.  \\n \\nSexual Conduct/Activity Relationships (Consensual) \\n(or the appearance of) \\nGrounded in Christ -centered traditions and principles, CCU’s values hold sexual \\nintercourse and other forms of sexual contact to be the unique expression of \\ncovenanted love within heterosexual marriage and are oriented toward family ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As a result, the University holds that any sexual activity outside of \\nheterosexual marriage is inappropriate and is a direct violation of our CCU Lifestyle \\nCovenant.

Studen ts enrolled at CCU engaging in such \\nactivity, either on - or off-campus, conflict with  this policy and are subject to \\ndisciplinary action.

Students engaged in such heterosexual relationships are \\nencouraged to practice only discreet and appropriate displays of affection in \\npublic. The University reserves the right to define and judge what types of public \\ndisplays of affection are permissible on its campus grounds and at University \\nsponsored events. Additionally, students should also be mindful of their displays \\nof affection in private.  Inappropriate conduct (for example, sleeping in the same \\nbed together) will also be addressed. \\n \\nA student who is known or suspected to be participating in a relationship, outside \\nof heterosexual marriage, involving sexual activity will be confronted about that \\nactivity by a University staff member or another member of the community.

It is important \\nto share some cautions and concerns about its use. \\n \\nFirst, students should be careful about how much and what kind of identifying \\ninformation is posted on these social networks.  Most of these networks are open \\nto anybody.   It is unwise to post information like date of birth, social security \\nnumber, address or phone number since it could leave students open to identity \\ntheft or stalking.   Students should also be aware that information posted could \\nreveal information not only about themselves, but also others they associate \\nwith.  These networks provide numer ous privacy settings for information \\ncontained in its pages; students should use these settings to protect these kinds \\nof private information. \\n \\nSecond, students should consider these networks as a place to confront others or \\nto settle disputes.

If \\nstudents are concerned about past behavior while a student at CCU, the student \\ncan come forward in a non-discipline agreement. \\n \\nRisk Reduction tips can often take a victim -blaming tone, even unintentionally. \\nWith no intention to blame the victim and with the recognition that only those \\nwho commit sexual violence are responsible for those actions, these suggestions \\nmay nevertheless help you to reduce your risk of experiencing a non -consensual \\nsexual act. \\n \\nStudents are advised, to the best of their ability, to try to refrain from being in a \\nsituation that could be potentially harmful. A victim is never to blame for an act \\ncommitted against them. The University also asks all its students to be aware of \\ntheir surroundings and to try to maintain their safety. Students are also reminded \\nof Romans 12:10: “Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above \\nyourselves.” Students should be respectful of one another as a child of God and \\nnever take advantage of somebody sexually. \\n● Discuss sexual limits as early as possible in a dating relationship, using the \\nstandards of the University as a foundation. \\n● Do not push sexual boundaries once they are set. \\n● If you are overly aroused, you may make a decision that doesn’t fit with \\nyour values. Get out of the situation. \\n● Tell a sexual aggressor “No” clearly and firmly, while recognizing that your \\nexpression of a clear “No” may not be honored. \\n● When you hear “No,” stop what you are doing and leave the situation. \\nTalk about what happened later. \\n● Just because your partner’s body eventually responds to the sexual touch, \\ndoes not mean that the encounter is consensual. Listen for a “No.” Pay \\nattention to physical cues. If he/she is not engaging or responding, they \\nmay have a stress or shock reaction. Consensual sexual acts do not \\ntypically result in stress or shock reactions. Stop the behavior and check-\\nin. \\n● Try to remove yourself from the physical presence of a sexual aggressor.  \\n● Do not be a sexual aggressor. \\n● Find someone nearby and ask for help. \\n● Acknowledge that alcohol/drugs lower your sexual inhibitions and may \\nmake you vulnerable to someone who views an intoxicated or high \\nperson as a sexual exploitation opportunity. \\n● Realize that alcohol/drugs lower your sexual inhibitions and may make \\nyou vulnerable to pushing boundaries that you might not push when you \\nare sober. \\n● Take care of your friends and ask that they take care of you.

All full -time (12 credit hours or more), \\nunmarried, 20 years old and younger, first and second-year students taking \\ncourses in the College of Undergraduate Studies are required to live on campus \\nand have a campus meal plan through the University food service plans.  \\n \\nThere is no waiver from the first- and second-year residency requirement except \\nfor students to live at home in the Denver metro area with parents or legal \\nguardians. In addition, since the University requires all first- and second -year \\nstudents to automatically sign up for housing, those under the age of 21 who wish \\nto live off campus with parents or legal guardians must submit a completed \\n“Residency Requirement Waiver” form to the Residence Life Office. Waivers from \\nthe residency requirement are extremely rare, but requests may be made by \\nsubmitting a co mpleted “Residency Requirement Waiver” form. Students will be \\nnotified via email of the University’s decision to uphold or waive the residency \\nrequirement generally within five business days of the request. Students who do \\nnot comply with the housing residency requirement will be automatically assigned \\nan on-campus housing space and billed at the corresponding rate. \\n \\nHousing contracts are effective throughout the entire academic year . Thus,  \\nstudents who change class standing during the fall -to-spring semester break are \\nstill required to complete the terms of the housing contract for the full academic \\nyear. Furthermore, the University must approve any student who is taking less \\nthan 12 credit hours and living in on-campus housing. More information regarding \\nall of these policies may be obtained from the Residence Life Office. \\n \\nFood Service Requirements \\nAll unmarried first- and second -year students under the age of 21 living in on -\\ncampus (University -operated) housing are required to take meals on campus \\nthrough University food service plans. Students in their first year of college \\nfollowing high school graduation, regardless of the number o f college credits \\ncompleted, are required to choose one of the two Plan A options.

This temporary adjustment policy \\nwill be posted in the Residence Life Office for each holiday  if policies are being \\nadjusted. Students should presume that regular policies are in effect unless posted \\ndifferently. \\n \\nHouse Governing System \\nFrom time to time the University may designate certain areas of the Residence Life \\nsystem as House Governing areas. Normally junior and senior students will have \\nan opportunity in these areas to designate by vote their community’s rules and \\npolicies. The policies for that area will remain for that area only. Underclassmen \\nvisiting these areas will be held to the regular policies of the campus residences. \\nResidence Life staff will assist in the voting process and advise the community on \\nwhich policies are av ailable to be voted on. The University reserves the right to \\ndelineate which policies can be changed and those that cannot be changed by the \\nstudent vote. \\n \\nQuiet Hours \\nThe University residences are under quiet hours from 10:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M., \\nSunday through Thursday, and during the weekend (Friday and Saturday nights) \\nfrom 12:00 A.M. (midnight) to 8:00 A.M. During quiet hours, it is the University’s \\nexpectation that the community noise is at a level that students can sleep and \\nstudy. During this time, noise in the residences should not be heard in the stairwell \\nor apartments above or below. Any conversation in the stairwells or outside \\naround buildings should be kept to a low level. The basketball court and volleyball \\ncourt near Yetter Hall and Waite are closed at 10:00 P.M. Students can expect to \\nbe documented for a quiet hour violation immediately during this period, and \\ncontinued noise during this time may result in a temporary eviction off-campus. If \\na residence staff member contacts a student during this period for a noise \\nviolation, the student should consider him/herself documented for violating quiet \\nhour policies.

RA’s are available to help coach students \\nregarding how to have such a conversation with a roommate or friend.  \\n \\nIf a conflict cannot be resolved interpersonally, students are encouraged, as the \\nnext step, to use their RA’s to mediate such conflicts in the interest of coming to a \\nworkable solution. In times when one roommate comes forward to a Residence \\nLife staff member concerned about a conflict or a disciplinary situation, he/she will \\nbe given several possible options:  \\n● Go back to the student(s) in question and confront the behavior,  \\n● Have a Residence Life representative mediate the dispute or situation  \\n● Have a Residence Life staff member confront the situation. \\n● Do nothing, which immediately gives the student coming forward some \\ntime to think and pray about the situation.  \\n \\nIn these instances, a Residence Life staff member will ask the student coming \\nforward to sign a document acknowledging the path that the student wishes to \\ntake in solving the situation. \\n \\nIf a student desires mediation assistance from a Residence Life staff member, the \\nfollowing process will be followed to assist students in reconciling  and finding \\nreasonable arrangements in roommate conflicts. Our roommate resolution \\nprocess is a three -step progression of mediation. Most resolutions should be \\nreconciled at the Resident Assistant or Counseling Center levels. \\n \\nStep 1: RA/RD Intervention: \\nThe ARD/RA level should be the first chance to engage in  a potential \\nroommate conflict.

These \\ntypes may include individual counseling, roommate change, or other \\npertinent interventions.

For more tips on talking to a friend or roommate about a conflict, \\nplease feel free to discuss your specific situation with any Residence Life staff \\nmember. \\n● Mediation should not take more than 1 hour. \\n● Any mediation facilitated by counselors or RDs should be done in an \\noffice/professional setting. \\n● Mediations are solution -focused, meaning that all parties must be \\ninterested in finding tangible ways to reverse interactions between \\nresidents. This should not be focused on personality issues. Only relevant \\nhistory that will help result in a resolution should be given merit. \\n● The role of a mediator is not to solve the issue  or mandate; instead, the \\ngoal is to facilitate purposeful dialogue and educate residents on patterns \\nof behavior, communication, and how to resolve problems of difference. \\nMediators should never suggest that someone is right or wrong; instead, \\nthey may point out inconsistencies and help facilitate win-win solutions. \\n● Mediators should educate residents on how to listen and communicate \\nrespectfully. This is done through setting boundaries. \\n● Mediators will be sensitive to understanding where students are \\ndevelopmentally and what each person can do to encourage each in their \\ngrowth process. \\n \\nVisitation \\nThese suggestions and policies are based on the need for respect and \\nconsideration among roommates and to assist couples in maintaining the purity of \\ntheir relationships. Apartment visitation by the opposite sex is to be conducted \\nwith discretion. It is suggested that other individuals be present in the apartment \\nwhile a guest of the opposite sex is visiting. Students who are having difficulty with \\nroommates taking advantage of the visitation policy should consult their \\nroommates first and then bring the situation to the attention of the RA in the \\ncommunity. \\n● In all freshman areas and for all freshman students, guests of the opposite \\nsex are allowed from 10:00 A.M. – 10:00 P.M.

When students drop just one or two courses, refunds will \\nonly apply when the remaining credits are below the block tuition rates (12 -18 \\nhours) or a student drops a class in the overload category. \\n \\nIn the College of Undergraduate Studies, a grade of “W” (withdraw) is assigned to \\ncourses dropped after the Wednesday of the second week of the fall and spring \\nterms and before the thirteenth week of the semester (Please see the calendar to \\nidentify the exact date.). After the start of the thirteenth week, students will be \\ngiven whatever grade they earn in the class. All course changes must be made with \\nthe Life Directions Center advisor’s approval. Unless a course is officially dropped, \\ncharges will continue since the student remains enrolled. Students who withdraw \\nfrom a course after the Add/Drop deadline (and before the Withdrawal Deadline) \\nwill receive a grade of W (Withdrawn) and charges will remain on the student’s \\naccount. Students who unofficially withdraw f rom a course after the Add/Drop \\ndeadline (and before the Withdrawal deadline) will receive a grade of FW \\n(Unauthorized Withdrawal) and charges will remain on the student’s account.  \\n \\nStudents in the BSN program should consult the BSN handbook for program -\\nspecific policies. \\n \\nStudents who are not registered for a course will not be permitted to attend \\nclasses or participate in academic coursework. \\n \\nAssignment Submissions \\nStudents are responsible for retaining an electronic copy of all assignments \\nsubmitted for grading until final course grades have been posted.

Policies for required CCU curricular (or co-curricular) activities: \\nAn absence is excused if the absence is a result of a formal, required \\ncurricular activity (i.e. , field trip for another course) or a co -curricular \\nassignment that the student must attend (i.e., athletics, academic \\ncompetition, or music performance). If two course activities (e.g. class \\nconcert, Symposium) are scheduled for the same time, it is the student’s \\nresponsibility to coordinate with the professors to determine which \\nactivity will be missed and how to make it up. If a satisfactory decision \\ncannot be reached, the student may approach the dean(s) to continue \\nworking on an adequate solution. All decisions will be made on a case-by-\\ncase basis.   \\nNotifications of impending co-curricular absences will come from the \\nprofessor, coach, or CCU faculty or staff. Only those on a team who are \\ntraveling receive the excused absence. Athletic practices and/or music \\npractices are not excused. In special circumstances, such as playoff \\nsituations, the faculty will be given notification as soon as possible of the \\nimpending absences of those students traveling as a team. However, \\nbecause of the nature of these types of activities (playoff games), the \\nnotification may be “last minute”. \\n2. Policies for verified medical/mental health absences: \\nAn absence is excused if the absence is a result of a serious illness or \\nsignificant mental health issue, with documentation by a medical \\nprofessional. An absence may be excused if the absence is a result of a \\nserious illness or death of an extended family  member (parent, \\nstepparent, sibling, step- sibling, grandparent, or another close relative). \\nProfessors will use their judgment, subject to the dean’s discretion, \\nregarding excused absences for a relative’s serious illness or a death.  \\nIn addition, an absence is excused for University -sanctioned events (athletics, \\nmusic, academic travel, etc.). Each student should communicate closely with \\nhis/her professors about a course’s specific absence policies. However, even when \\na student is excus ed because of an absence, the student is expected to complete \\nall assignments, quizzes, and exams, as negotiated with the professor.  \\n \\nThere are two categories of medical/mental health absences: short term (2 \\nconsecutive classes) and long term (3 consecutive classes or more).  \\n1.

We view the \\nchapel as a critical component of the CCU spiritual formation, corporate worship,  \\nand spiritual community experience. Chapels are carefully and intentionally \\nplanned to “inspire the heart” more than just “inform the head,” although both \\nare important. Student -led worship teams, chapel speakers, and other approved \\nchapel events seek to provide opportunities to “worship God in spirit and truth” \\nby: \\n● Encouraging and promoting an intimate, personal relationship with God \\nthrough worship. \\n● Providing inspiring and challenging, biblically-based teaching intended to \\ntransform personal living. \\n● Complementing the work of the local church and the classroom through \\ncreative, effective communication on topics relevant to University \\nstudents. \\n● Providing a corporate and spiritual experience to promote CCU unity in \\nChrist. \\n \\nChapel Attendance Policies \\nBecause we value and view the priority of corporate worship and a chapel \\nexperience, attendance at CCU-sanctioned chapels is  a graduation requirement. \\nJust like going through any university will mean arranging work, family , and other \\nconflicts around attending required classes, so going through CCU will mean \\narranging work, family, and other conflicts around attending required chapels. We \\nvalue chapel participation on the same level as class participation, so plan your \\nschedules to include chapels. \\n● CCU students are expected to complete 180 chapel credits over a four -year \\nperiod to graduate. Chapel requirements include completing 23 chapel credits \\nper semester while at CCU. If students attend CCU for less than 8 semesters, \\nthey can receive a pro -rated reduction in chapel requirements. Note: 90% of \\nchapel credits must be completed to participate in commencement. \\n● Chapel is held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 10:50 – 11:40 A.M. in \\nthe CCU Event Center, unless announced otherwise. Other spiritual formation \\nactivities are also eligible for chapel credit; these activities will be noted on \\nthe extra credit chapel schedule each semester. \\n● To receive credit for attended chapels, students must do the following:  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Because the chapel requirement can be \\naccomplished in a three -year period, and extra -credit chapel opportunities \\nabound, the online chapel program is offered for only the following students : \\n● Students who have completed their academic courses but have not finished \\ntheir chapel credits. \\n● Students who are enrolled in the study abroad program and who desire to \\nstay connected to the CCU community and maintain their chapel \\nresponsibilities while living away from the CCU campus. \\n● Students in the education majors doing their student teaching off-campus and \\nare physically not able to attend chapel on Tuesday and Thursday.  \\n● Students who have very unique  medical, personal, family or other situations \\nwhich prevent them from attending the Tuesday and Thursday chapels.  \\n \\nOnline Chapel Requirements: \\nTo earn chapel credits through the online program, the following guidelines are \\nused: \\n● Application for online chapel (via an e-form application) must be made \\neach semester prior to the add/drop deadline, and the coursework  must \\nbe completed by the first day of finals week. There may be an additional \\nregistration fee for the online chapel. \\n● Once students are registered, they will be given access to the online \\nchapel “course” whereby they can listen to each live-streamed chapel (at \\ntheir own convenience)  and complete and pass a quiz that  verifies their \\nadequate listening and engagement with the chapel program. \\n● Not all Tuesday/Thursday chapels will qualify for online chapel credit (i.e., \\nworship, awards, etc.). \\n● In addition, students doing on-line chapel may attend (and receive chapel \\ncredit) for any extra-credit chapels concurrently.

Having such a community requires \\nestablishing standards that reflect our CCU institutional mission and provide a \\nframework for student behavior.  \\n \\nAt every function of Colorado Christian University, the individuals involved must \\nrepresent Christ. We are ambassadors of Christ and our actions must reflect this \\nfact. Part of this is committing to consider our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ \\nand avoid behavior that may offend, tempt or hurt others. It is in this spirit that \\nthe following guidelines are created. \\n \\n“Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is \\nhelpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those \\nwho listen.” Ephesians 4:29 \\n \\n1.

Traveling with a group of students requires \\nplanning and coordination on the part of the trip leader to help ensure a safe and \\nfun trip. CCU defines student travel to be students who are a part of University \\nbusiness, athletics, campus activi ties, academics, or other departmental event, \\ntraveling from CCU in a University or privately -owned vehicle. All requests for \\nstudent travel must be done through the Director of Campus Activities and \\nLeadership and the following guidelines must be adhered to: \\nBefore the trip: \\n1. Trips which are required or carry an implication of requirement for \\ncoursework or involvement in a campus club/organization/ministry must be \\naccompanied by a faculty or staff member. If travel is a required element of a \\nclass, a transportation option must be provided. \\n2. Each student must complete an Adult Liability Release form and return it to \\nthe staff/ faculty person in charge of the trip. If a student is under 18, his or \\nher parent must sign this form so these forms should be distributed with \\nenough advance notice to obtain any needed parent signatures. \\n3. Each student should obtain his or her insurance information. Students should \\nbring their personal insurance cards and any other information that might be \\npertinent in an emergency. \\n4. Each student should complete an “In Case of Emergency Contact” form. This \\nform should include information about a friend or relative to contact in an \\nemergency as well as any allergies or other medical conditions the student \\nmight possess. \\n5. Hold an informational meeting before the trip. Discuss the area you will visit \\nalong with any risks that could be involved and go over any specific training \\n(van driving, rock climbing, etc.). Review all relevant University policies. \\nRemind the students that the same visitation and alcohol policies are in effect \\nduring the trip. \\n6. Provide a list of all students going on the trip to the Director of Campus \\nActivities and Leadership. He or she will give a copy to the Student Life Office \\nManager to keep on file with the Student Life Department. \\n7.

It is recommended \\nthat students send address change notifications in April to prepare for summer \\nbreak. \\n \\nCommunication with Students \\nThe University will use various ways to communicate with students. The primary \\nmeans of communication is through the e -mail address that was assigned to the \\nstudent at the time of enrollment. Students are responsible for all information \\nreceived at that e-mail.  If a student is unaware of their e -mail address or how to \\ncheck that e-mail, they can contact the Help Desk at 303-963-3444. The University \\nmay also use a student’s mobile phone number for texts or calls to notify about \\nemergency procedures or other important University information. \\n \\nEmergency Contact Registration and Missing Person Protocol \\nThe University requests of all students each year that they provide, on a voluntary \\nbasis, emergency contact information. This information will also be used in the \\nfollowing manner in the event that a student is reported missing while at the \\ninstitution. \\n \\nIf a Colorado Christian University student living in University -operated housing is \\nsuspected to be missing from campus, immediately report it to a Residence Life \\nstaff member (i.e. RD, RA) or Campus Security at 303 -963-3222.

If the investigation \\ndetermines that the student has been missing for over 24 hours, then within the \\nnext 24 hours the University will: \\n● Notify the individual identified as the emergency contact person. \\n● If under 18 years of age, the University will notify a parent or guardian .  \\n● If over 18 years of age and have not provided an emergency contact, the \\nUniversity will notify the appropriate law enforcement agency. \\n \\n \\n \\n ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

To graduate from the \\nCUS program, every student must complete a ministry hours requirement. Total \\nhours required are based on the number of semesters a student attends CCU (22.5 \\nhours/semester), including semesters in which a student is enrolled part -time. A \\ntraditional four -year student will complete 180 hours of service.  Students \\npursuing a Nursing degree are required to complete a total of 90 ministry hours.  \\nBecause of the structure of ministry hours and ease of accomplishing these hours \\nin the years that  students are enrolled at CCU, waivers for the  ministry \\nrequirement will not be granted. The Weekend of Welcome is the first opportunity \\nfor new students to obtain ministry hours. \\n \\nThe purpose of the ministry hours requirement is to encourage students to \\ndevelop a Lifestyle of service to others and can explore different areas of service \\nand vocational calling. The heart of the ministry hours requirement is to encourage \\nstudents to expand their comfort zone and explore ways to serve people outside \\nof their immediate circle. For this reason, a maximum of 25% of a student’s \\nministry hours can be service to those within the CCU community (On Campus \\nHours) and a maximum of 25% can be Academic hours. Off-campus Ministry hours \\ncan be 100% of the required hours and may be completed at church, para-church, \\nnot-for-profit service organizations, or at various other organizations, as well as, \\nserving individual people. \\n \\nStudents cannot accept payment for hours they wish to submit for ministry hours \\n(with a few exceptions).     \\n• Paid Student leaders: Students may count 30% of the total hours served.  \\n• Non-paid student leaders: Students may count 100% of the hours served.  \\nStudent leader hours are counted as on-campus service which is restricted to \\n25% of the total hours needed to graduate.

Membership must be open to all Colorado Christian University students \\nwithout regard to race, color, national or ethnic origin, handicap, sex or \\nreligion (restricted membership may be granted if the organization provides \\njustification for this special stat us). Only CUS students enrolled at CCU may \\nparticipate in organization activities unless special permission is granted by \\nthe Assistant Director of Campus Activities & Leadership or their designee. \\n3. Student organizations must have a CCU faculty or staff advisor. This puts the \\nresponsibility on the organization to find an advisor. The advisor must attend \\ntraining and be involved with the group’s planning and implementation of \\ngroup activities.

CCU will not tolerate \\nderogatory or negative comments, bad language, references to or \\npictures of alcohol, tobacco or drug usage, and poor representation of \\nthe student, the student’s name, family, or anything of this kind. \\n● Students should reconsider utilizing their organizational page as a place \\nto confront others and/or settle disputes. Many of these conversations \\nare open to the public and comments made can be hurtful to others as \\nwell as damaging to their witness.

CCU identifies course grades below a C - as indicating a possible academic \\nstruggle. The LDC Student Success Coordinator and advisors reach out to these \\nstudents to offer support, encouragement , and resources. Because a student’s \\ngrade can change very rapidly, depending on the completion and grading of \\nassignments and various other factors, these processes will not identify every \\nstruggling student.

We strive to \\nprovide financial resources to students so they can integrate faith and learning in a scholarly \\nenvironment, and embrace the authority of Scripture and Christ as the center of life. Ultimately, our aim \\nis to prepare students to engage the world as leaders, transforming their professions, churches, and \\ncommunities. \\nIntroduction \\nThe purpose of this handbook is to provide both students and parents with an informative guide to \\nfinancial aid. Please read this information carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, please \\ncontact Student Financial Services directly at 303-963-3230 or financialaidsupport@securemail.ccu.edu.  \\nColorado Christian University recommends that all families complete the Free Application for Federal \\nStudent Aid (FAFSA) annually. This allows for the full range of financial aid options, including all federal \\nand state financial aid programs and CCU institutional aid programs.  \\nStudent financial aid is one source of helping you meet the cost of attendance at CCU. Families are \\nexpected to contribute towards the cost of attendance from either their own resources or from outside \\nresources. Students are also encouraged to search for scholarships from outside sources.  \\nColorado Christian University reserves the right to change financial aid policies without notice. \\nWhat Kind of Financial Aid is Available \\nColorado Christian University students may be eligible for federal grants, federal loans, and federal work \\nstudy programs. Students who are residents of Colorado may be eligible for financial aid programs \\noffered by the Colorado Department of Education including grants and work study.  All full-time College \\nof Undergraduate Studies (CUS) students may be eligible for a variety of institutional grants and \\nscholarships. Outside scholarships can also be researched through your local library or on the Internet.  \\nBasic Terms of Financial Aid \\nCost of Attendance \\nThe Cost of Attendance (COA) figures are the estimated budget projections for nine months of \\nattendance at Colorado Christian University. The student’s COA may vary depending on housing selection. \\nDetailed information about current tuition, fees, and housing costs is available at www.ccu.edu/finaid.  \\nStudent Aid Index\\nAs defined by the Department of Education, Student Aid Index (SAI) is “a measure of your family’s \\nfinancial strength and is calculated according to a formula established by law.” Your SAI is not the amount \\nof money your family will have to pay for college nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will \\nreceive. It is a number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible \\nto receive based on information provided on the FAFSA. \\nCost of Attendance (COA) – Student Aid Index (SAI) - Other Financial Assistance (OFA) = Financial Need ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The SAI reported on the FAFSA \\nSubmission Summary (FSS) is based on Federal Methodology. The Federal Methodology is used to \\ndetermine a student’s eligibility for all federal aid, including Federal Pell Grants, Federal Stafford Loans, \\nand Federal Work-Study. The SAI may also be used to determine a student’s eligibility for the financial \\naid programs offered by the Colorado Department of Education.   \\nThe family contribution is determined by two figures, the parent contribution (for dependent students) \\nand the student contribution. (There is no parent contribution for independent students.) The factors \\nmost critical in determining what parents are expected to pay include income, assets, the number of \\nfamily members, and the number of children currently enrolled in an undergraduate college. Student \\nearnings plus student assets are used to determine the student contribution. For independent students, \\nthe income and assets of the spouse are also considered. \\nDependency Status \\nAs cited from the Student Guide published by the Department of Education: “When you apply for federal \\nstudent aid, your answers to certain questions will determine whether you are considered dependent on \\nyour parents or independent. If you are considered dependent on your parents, you must report their \\nincome and assets as well as your own. If you are independent, you must report only your own income \\nand assets (and those of your spouse, if you are married).”  \\nYou are considered an independent student for financial aid purposes if you can answer yes to at least \\none of the following statements:  \\n1. I was born before January 1, 2001\\n2. I am married. (Also answer yes if you are separated but not divorced.)\\n3. I will be working on a master’s degree program.\\n4.

If \\na FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) contains the message “Your application has been selected for \\nreview in a process called verification,” the Student Financial Services office is required by the federal \\ngovernment to collect verification information.  \\nStudents who have not been selected for verification do not need to complete verification documents. If \\nverification is required, the student (and parents or spouse if required) should complete the requested \\ndocuments promptly and return them with other needed documents to the Student Financial Services \\noffice.  For 2024-25, students are selected for one of three verification tracking groups. The \\nimplementation of these three groups limits the items that most students must verify, and speeds the \\nverification process.  \\nThe FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) is available for the 2024-25 FAFSA. This new update was \\ncreated to transfer Federal Tax Information (FTI) directly to the FAFSA from IRS to address security \\nconcerns and to better protect applicants’ sensitive information. To minimize errors and delays in \\nprocessing, all contributors on the FAFSA must provide consent to transfer FTI data in order to be eligible \\nfor federal aid. \\nCCU’s financial aid verification process must be completed online. All verification items will be \\ncompleted and submitted through the online Studentforms platform. CCU will only accept 2024-25 \\nverification documents submitted online through Studentforms. On Studentforms, students will see \\ntasks that must be completed for review by the financial aid processing team. Students will receive \\ncorrespondence about any details of their documents that may need to be corrected. \\nStudents who have been selected for general verification must attach the 2022 Federal IRS Tax Return \\nTranscripts by the student and parent(s) (if a dependent student), or student and spouse (if married). \\nStudents are not required to submit Federal Tax Return Transcripts if they transferred FTI data from IRS \\nwhen they completed their FAFSA. If the student or parent updates FAFSA information, other \\ndocumentation may be required. Students or parents who amend their original tax return may also be \\nrequired to submit additional documentation.  \\nStudents can obtain a tax transcript, free of charge, by: (1) ordering a transcript online at \\nhttp://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-TranscriptGet Transcript; (2) ordering by calling 1-800-908-9946; or \\n(3) requesting a Transcript of Tax Return by using Form 4506T-EZ (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506tez.pdf). \\nTo complete verification, additional documentation, such as 2022 W-2s, may be required.

A FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) will be sent to the student as a result of filing \\nthe FAFSA. For dependent students, the information on the FSS must agree with the parents’ and \\nstudent’s 2022 federal income tax transcripts and any other information the family has provided to us. \\nIndependent student’s FSS information must agree with the student’s 2022 federal income tax \\ntranscripts and any other information provided.

If corrections are \\nmade, any federal aid amounts may change and the financial aid award will change accordingly. \\nStudents should contact the Student Financial Services office for any questions about the FSS.  \\nFederal Pell Grants \\nFederal Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who qualify financially. Unlike a loan, they do \\nnot have to be paid back to the government. Eligibility is based on a formula which is revised and \\napproved by Congress annually. The amount of funding is based on the student’s financial need. The \\nmaximum Federal Pell Grant for the 2024-25 award year (July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025) is $7,395.  \\nThe Department of Education has reduced the duration of a student’s eligibility to receive a Federal Pell \\nGrant to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). The calculation of the duration of a student’s eligibility will \\ninclude all years of the student’s receipt of Federal Pell Grant funding. Once a student has received a \\nBachelor’s degree he/she is no longer eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.  \\nStudents may receive Pell Grant funds up to 150 percent of their Pell Grant Scheduled Award for an \\naward year, allowing students to take classes in the summer that are Pell eligible. Students must maintain \\nat least half-time enrollment in the term to be eligible for this additional year-round disbursement.  \\nUnusual Enrollment History \\nThe Department of Education flags certain students with Unusual Enrollment History.  The UEH flag \\nindicates whether the student has an unusual enrollment history in regard to the receipt of Federal Pell \\nGrant funds, and is intended to address possible fraud and abuse in the Title IV student aid programs. \\nSpecifically, the flag addresses a student history of attending an institution long enough to receive a Title \\nIV credit balance but not completing the enrollment period and not earning academic credit for the Pell \\nGrant received. \\nFor students who have the Unusual Enrollment History flag, CCU is required to review previous \\nenrollment for the past four award years to determine whether there are valid reasons for the unusual \\nenrollment history.  Students must provide official transcripts from all colleges and universities enrolled \\nin which they received Pell and Stafford funding for 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24. Once \\nofficial transcripts are received CCU will determine if academic credit was earned at these institutions \\nduring the semesters in which the student received federal financial aid. Title IV student aid will not be \\ndisbursed until a determination of earned academic credit can be made. Until this determination is made, \\nfuture registration will be on hold, awaiting students’ eligibility for Title IV student aid. \\nFederal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) \\nSEOG grants are awarded to undergraduate students who qualify financially. Like the Federal Pell Grant, \\nthis is money that does not need to be paid back to the government. Unlike the Federal Pell Grant, funds \\nare very limited. Each school is given an allotment, which they must then award to the neediest students.

The \\nfederal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half time (six credit \\nhours per semester). Students have a grace period of six months before they enter repayment. For loans \\nfirst disbursed on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014, interest will accrue during the grace \\nperiod, and students must repay this accrued interest once they enter repayment. Borrowers of \\nSubsidized Stafford Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2014 are once again eligible for the interest \\nsubsidy during the six-month grace period. \\nBeginning July 1, 2013, a new Stafford Loan borrower becomes ineligible to receive additional Direct \\nSubsidized Loans if the period during which the borrower has received such loans exceeds 150 percent of \\nthe published length of the borrower’s educational program. A new or “first-time” borrower is defined as \\na student who has no outstanding principal balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on the date \\nthe borrower obtains a Direct Loan on or after July 1, 2013. The borrower becomes responsible for \\naccruing interest during all periods as of the date the borrower exceeds the 150 percent limit. \\nSubsidized Direct Federal Stafford Loans are awarded based on financial need.  Students who do not \\nqualify for a Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan are awarded an Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan. \\nGraduate and professional students are no longer eligible to receive Subsidized Stafford Loans made for a \\nperiod of enrollment beginning on or after July 1, 2012. Graduate and professional students will be \\nawarded Unsubsidized Stafford Loans in place of Subsidized Stafford Loans. \\nA student may not borrow more than the cost of attendance for his or her education at Colorado \\nChristian University, less expected family contributions and other financial aid. The student must show \\nfinancial need, and be aware that the amount of need may limit the size of the Subsidized Federal \\nStafford Loan. Loan proceeds arrive in equal disbursements, typically at the beginning of each semester of \\nthe award period. \\nUnsubsidized Direct Stafford Loans \\nUnsubsidized Direct Stafford Loans are available for undergraduate students who do not have full or any \\nSubsidized Direct Stafford Loan eligibility, or for independent undergraduate students who need more aid \\nthan a Subsidized Direct Stafford Loan can provide. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are also available to \\ngraduate and professional students. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans have the same terms as the Subsidized \\nStafford Loan except that the student, rather than the government, pays the interest while the student is \\nstill in school.  \\nDirect Stafford Loan Interest Rates \\nThe interest rate for undergraduate Stafford loans first disbursed between July 1, 2024 and June 30, \\n2025 is fixed at 6.53%. This rate applies to both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans.  \\nInterest rates on federal student loans are set by Congress, and are calculated using a base 10-year \\nTreasury Note index with an add-on amount for each loan program. All Stafford Direct Loans are variable-\\nfixed. The interest rate can change from year to year, but the rate for each new loan is fixed for the life of \\nthe loan. \\nThere is a loan fee assessed by the Department of Education on all Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized \\nStafford Loans. The loan fee is a percentage of the amount of each loan students receive. Due to the \\nBudget Control Act of 2011 which put into place automatic federal budget cuts known as the sequester, \\nchanges were made in the Direct Loan fees. For Direct loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and \\nbefore October 1, 202, the fee on students’ loans is 1.057%.

For this reason, it \\nis strongly recommended that the student make the interest payments while in school.  \\nRepayment begins 6 months after the student leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment status. \\nMinimum monthly payments are $50. The loan servicer generally must allow at least 5 years for \\nrepayment of the loan, but can allow up to 10 years.

For FX, W, and FW grades, \\nthe Last Day of Attendance (LDA) is used to calculate the amount of federal financial aid the student has \\nearned. \\nEarned and Unearned Title IV financial aid \\nThe percentage of the payment period the student attended is used to calculate the amount of the \\nstudent’s earned versus unearned federal aid funds.   \\n\\uf0b7 If a student completes over 60% of the days he or she was scheduled to complete, the student is\\nconsidered to have earned 100% of the Title IV funding for the semester.\\n\\uf0b7 If a student completes 60% or less of the days he or she was scheduled to complete, the amount\\nof aid that the student has not earned (i.e. unearned aid) must be returned to the specific federal\\nprogram.  The remaining earned aid may not be sufficient to cover the University charges and a\\nbalance due may result.\\nDeferments \\nPeriods during which payment of principal on a Federal Stafford loan is postponed are called deferments. \\nDeferments include periods of at least half-time enrollment determined by an eligible institution, study \\non an eligible graduate fellowship, and approved rehabilitation training programs for disabled individuals. \\nStudents should contact their loan servicer for additional deferment options.  \\nStudents who are returning to school after a leave of absence will need to secure a deferment form \\nfrom their loan servicer and take it to Student Financial Services to verify their enrollment status to the \\nloan servicer.  \\nAggregate Limits \\nA student may only borrow up to a certain amount of Stafford Loan Funds for their education, including \\namounts borrowed for attendance at previous institutions. The aggregate unpaid principle balance of all \\nStafford Loans may not exceed the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Dependent Undergraduate = $31,000, with the subsidized portion of the loan amount not to\\nexceed $23,000\\n\\uf0b7 Independent Undergraduate = $57,500 with the subsidized portion of the loan amounts not to\\nexceed $23,000.\\n\\uf0b7 Graduate and Post-Baccalaureate professional = $138,500 with the subsidized portion of the loan\\namounts not to exceed $65,500. (Note: beginning July 1, 2012, graduate and professional\\nstudents are no longer eligible to receive Subsidized Stafford Loans.) The graduate debt limit\\nincludes all federal loans received for undergraduate study.\\nExit Counseling \\nExit counseling is mandatory for borrowers leaving the University. Loan terms and conditions as well as \\nrepayment options are covered. \\nParent Loans and Alternative Financing \\nParents and students may want to consider some of the following alternatives to assist in paying for costs \\nat Colorado Christian University. Students and their parents often combine options to finance college \\ncosts. The following are some resources that may be of interest.

Please make sure you notify the CCU Student Financial Services office of any assistance \\nreceived from an outside source.  \\nDirect Parent PLUS Loans \\nDirect Parent PLUS loans are low-interest loans made to the parent of an undergraduate dependent \\nstudent attending at least half-time (six credit hours per semester). A Direct PLUS loan is subject to credit \\napproval. A parent may borrow up to the cost of education as determined by CCU’s Director of Financial \\nAid, minus any other aid received. Students must complete the FAFSA to be eligible to receive a Parent \\nPLUS loan.  \\nPLUS loans disbursed on or after July 1, 202 ϰ and before July 1, 202 ϱ will have a fixed interest rate \\nof 8.05%. The loan fee for Direct PLUS loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2020 and before \\nOctober 1, 2024 is 4.228%. The fee will be deducted proportionately each time a loan disbursement \\nis made.  \\nFederal PLUS loan proceeds are sent directly to Colorado Christian University through Electronic Funds \\nTransfer (EFT). Once the university receives a disbursement, the student’s enrollment status is verified, \\nand the funds are applied to the student’s account. Loan proceeds arrive in two equal disbursements, the \\nsecond arriving halfway through the loan period (usually the start of the second semester). Repayment \\nbegins within sixty days of the final disbursement, but may be deferred while the student is enrolled at \\nleast half-time at CCU. A Direct Parent Plus loan cannot be transferred to the child. The parent is \\nresponsible for repaying the loan. \\nBecause of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, beginning July, 2010, all Parent PLUS loans \\ncome directly from the U.S. Department of Education under the Direct Loan Program. Parents can visit \\nthe U.S. Department of Education website to complete the PLUS request process. \\nPrivate Education Loans \\nMany lending institutions offer education loans to students enrolled in a degree seeking program to assist \\nthem in meeting the costs of higher education. For those students whose eligibility for federal loan \\nprograms do not meet their financial needs, it may be necessary to look to Private Credit loans for \\nadditional assistance. These loan programs are credit based and virtually all dependent students require a \\nco-borrower to qualify. Interest rates and repayment terms vary by lender. If students chose an \\nAlternative loan, we recommend that they borrow conservatively. \\nChoosing a lender for an Alternative Loan is a personal decision and it is important students research \\navailable interest rates as well as repayment options and borrower benefits. CCU advises students to \\nselect a lender through ELMSelect. On this site we have recommended lenders based on the quality of \\nproducts and services they provide to CCU students and families. Students may evaluate each lender, and \\nmake a selection based on the benefits provided to the borrower. \\nAfter the student has applied for an Alternative loan, the loan has been approved and the promissory \\nnote has been signed, CCU will certify the loan. Funds are usually disbursed within 3-5 business days, or \\nthe beginning of the semester. \\nAutomatic Monthly Payment Plan  \\nTo help students meet their educational expenses, Colorado Christian University is pleased to offer \\nTouchNet payment plans as a convenient budget plan. TouchNet provides a monthly payment plan in \\nwhich the student’s charges are divided over a number of months, dependent upon when enrolled in the \\nplan. The payments are taken out of a checking or savings account on the 1st or 15th of every month until ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Students commonly grant parents or spouses proxy access to their personal \\ninformation. Proxies can make payments, view student account activity and statements, access financial \\naid awards, and set up a payment plan. Please visit the Proxy Access webpage for more information. \\nVeterans’ Assistance \\nAll CUS programs offered at CCU have been approved for veterans and eligible dependents. Forms for \\nthis process are available from the Student Financial Services office or a military education center. When \\nVeterans’ Benefits are paid directly to students, they are required to pay their tuition and related \\nexpenses at the beginning of each semester through full payment, automatic monthly payments, or \\nfinancial aid. Contact the Student Financial Services office at VASupport@ccu.edu for more information. \\nPost-9/11 GI Bill® – Yellow Ribbon Program \\nGI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \\nCCU is a participating University and offers significant benefits under the Yellow Ribbon program. Eligible \\nstudents in CCU’s College of Undergraduate Studies will receive up to $10,000 per year in CCU benefits, \\nwhich will be matched dollar for dollar by the VA, for a total of $20,000.  The benefit is used to cover any \\ntuition and fees incurred beyond the base VA benefit fund of $27,120.05 for the 2023-24 academic \\nyear. The combined amount that CCU and the VA contribute toward student expenses may not exceed \\nthe student’s full cost of tuition and fees. An unlimited number of eligible students may participate in \\nYellow Ribbon Program benefits for the 2023-24 academic year. The benefit is renewable each year the \\nstudent maintains satisfactory progress, conduct and attendance.  \\nPost-9/11 GI Bill and Yellow Ribbon tuition and fees payments will be set up as a scholarship from the VA \\nand (in the case of the Yellow Ribbon match) from CCU. In other words, once students have established \\ntheir eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill and have registered for classes, CCU will award the Post-9/11 GI \\nBill and Yellow Ribbon scholarship amounts to the students' accounts after all other applicable \\nscholarships and grants have been applied. Any remaining balances due will be the student's \\nresponsibility.   \\nEach semester CCU will certify CUS courses before the term begins. Course schedule changes made after \\ncertification may jeopardize VA benefits. Students are encouraged to lock-in their registration by these \\ncertification dates: \\n\\uf0b7 Fall semester – classes certified August 1\\n\\uf0b7 Winter semester – classes certified December 1\\n\\uf0b7 Spring semester – classes certified January 1\\n\\uf0b7 Summer semester – classes certified May 1\\nCourse withdrawals and late drops will result in an adjustment to the certification dates to reflect \\nstudent’s Last Date of Attendance.
